Ufumanise ukuba urhulumente ukhokele ubungqina obaneleyo ukuba uMnu Moyo aziphendulele kwaye eze kwesi sigqibo, uMpofu uxelele iVOA esuka kwaBulawayo, kuWhatsApp.

Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.	Unobhala osisigxina kwiSebe lezoLwazi uNdabaningi Nick Mangwana uphawule ngesi sigwebo sangoLwesibini.
We just want to see that there's law and order. 	Sifuna nje ukubona ukuba kukho umthetho nocwangco.
If somebody has committed a crime or is percied, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system.	Ukuba umntu wophule umthetho okanye kuyacingelwa, uyakufumana usuku lwakhe enkundleni, ngoko ke ujongene nenkundla, ngoko ke isigqibo asikho sezandleni zethu, sisezandleni zenkqubo zobulungisa kulwaphulo mthetho.

Zimbabwe Government Orders Vaccinated Workers Back to Work.	Urhulumente waseZimbabwe uyalele abasebenzi abagonyiweyo ukuba babuyele emsebenzini.
Zimbabwes government has ordered civil servants who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to immediately report for duty after more than a year of working from home, citing a declining in new cases of the virus in the country.	Urhulumente waseZimbabwe uyalele abasebenzi bakarhulumente abathi bagonyelwe i-COVID-19 ukuba bakhawuleze baye emsebenzini emva konyaka besebenza ekhaya, echaza ukwehla kwamanani abantu abanalentsholongwane elizweni.
Authorities also announced any government workers without proof of vaccination will be barred from workplaces and face punishments, including a freeze on their salaries.	Abasemagunyeni baphinde babhengeza nabaphi na abasebenzi bakarhulumente abangenabo kobungqina bogonyo baya kuthintelwa kwiindawo zokusebenza kwaye bajongane nesohlwayo, kubandakanya nokumiswa kwemivuzo yabo.
In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person.	Kwingxelo kule veki, urhulumente kaMongameli uEmmerson Mnangagwa uthe ufuna abasebenzi bakhe baphinde baqalise ukuhlangana ngokobuqu.
Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.	 Ngorhatya lwangoLwesibini, uMonica Mutsvangwa, umphathiswa wezolwazi welizwe, uthe inani labantu abalaliswe esibhedlele ngenxa ye-COVID-19 liyehla ngokuthe ngcembe.
This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off.	“Oku kubonisa ukuba amanyathelo okusabela kuzwelonke asungulwe ngurhulumente ayaqhubeka nokuba neziqhamo.
"In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to,"" she said."	Ngobona ukwehla okuqhubekayo kumanani abantu abosuleleka sisifo sikazwelonke kunye nokufa, kudityaniswa nokwehla kwezinga labo baneziphumo ezimbi kuvavanyo okubonisa ukuba usulelo loluntu lwehlile, zonke iindawo zokungena kufuneka zivulwe kwakhona, kodwa kuqinisekiswe ukuba yonke imiqathango nemiyalelo  yokuzikhusela kwiCOVID-19 iyathotyelwa,” utshilo.
However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.	Nangona kunjalo, umthetho osisinyanzelo wogonyo awamkelwa ngabo bonke abasebenzi baseburhulumenteni.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.	Umongameli weAmalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, uObert Masaraure, uthi abasebenzi bazakuwusa enkundleni lo mcimbi ukuba urhulumente uyanyanzelisa.
A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.	“Ikhontrakthi eyasayinwa ngabasebenzi bakarhulumente ayinayo imiqathango yogonyo olunyanzeliswayo.
So if the Public Service Commission wants to bar civil servants who are not vaccinated, they are in breach of contract and its unacceptable.	Ngoko ke ukuba ikomishoni yekonzo zikarhulumente ifuna ukuvalela ngaphandle abasebenzi bakarhulumente abangagonywanga, bophula isivumelwano kwaye oko akwamkelekanga.
Secondly, civil servants have a right to dignity, they have right to make choices.	Okwesibini, abasebenzi bakarhulumente banelungelo lesidima, banelungelo lokuzikhethela.
"No one can be forced foreign substances to be inserted into their bodies,"" he noted."	Akekho umntu unokunyanzelwa ukuba kufakwe izinto zangaphandle emizimbeni yakhe,” utshilo.
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.	UGqirha Norman Matara, intloko yeZimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, uthi umbutho wakhe uqaphele ukuba amanye amazwe amaninzi ajonge kugonyo olusisinyanzelo.
It is something that we are strongly against. We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.	Yinto esichasene nayo kakhulu. Sicinga ukuba ukugunyazisa amayeza okugonya yinto ephembelela ukuthandabuza kogonyo.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory that goes around when people are saying we are being forced to be vaccinated.	Ininzi into ethethekayo ejikelezayo xa abantu besithi sinyanzelwa ukuba sigonywe.
"We really have to get the buy in of people: spread the gospel of vaccines, how they work and then encourage people to get vaccinated and not force them to get vaccinated,"" he pointed out."	Ngokwenene kufuneka sifumane imvume yabantu: sisasaze ulwazi ngogonyo, indlela asebenza ngayo emva koko sikhuthaze abantu ukuba bagonywe kwaye bangabanyanzeli ukuba bagonywe, ”utshilo.
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.	Kodwa uSifiso Ndlovu ophuma kwiZimbabwe Teachers Association uyaluxhasa uluvo lukarhulumente.
Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, bonke abasebenzi kufuneka bathathe ugonyo.
Not because they want to protect themselves, but they want to protect their colleagues at work.	Hayi ngokuba befuna ukuzikhusela, kodwa bafuna ukukhusela abantu abasebenza nabo emsebenzini.
Scientific evidence has it that if you are fully vaccinated it comes with a mild attack.	Ubungqina benzululwazi buthi ukuba ugonywe ngokupheleleyo luza nohlaselo olungephi.
"Why not take up that? There is nothing wrong or sinister about it,"" he said."	Kutheni ungayithathi loo nto? Akukho nto iphosakeleyo okanye imbi ngayo,” utshilo.
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.	Bamalunga ne-3.3 yezigidi abantu eZimbabwe abaye bafumana izitofu ezimbini ze-COVID-19, ngelixa malunga ne-86,000 befumene isitofu sesithathu.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused to get vaccinated, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.	Uninzi lwabantu baseZimbabwe abavumi ukugonywa, besithi abawathembi amayeza ogonyo eSinopharm kunye neSinovac enziwa eChina..
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa	Iikontraka zomkhosi zabucala zixhasa impembelelo yeRussia eAfrika
"Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the ""Wagner group"" — an entity with no known legal status."	"Amabhongo e-Russia malunga nezejiyografi kunye nezopolitiko e-Afrika kule minyaka yakutsha nje aye axhaswa ngoonokontraka babucala bazomkhosi, abasoloko bechazwa ngokuba ngamalungu ""iWagner"" - iqumrhu elingaziwayo ngokwasemthethweni."
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.	Kutshanje, izizwe zaseNtshona zikugxekile ukufika kwamajoni aseRussia kwikomkhulu laseMali iBamako, ibango elaliweyo yiJunta eyathatha amandla okuphatha ngo-2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.	Njenokuba ubudlelwane neFrance busiya busiba mandundu, abalawuli basemkhosini banokuthi bakhangela iindlela zokulungiselela ukuncipha kwenani lemikhosi yaseYurophu ebikade isilwa ukuvukela kweJihadist yaseMali iminyaka.
"Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm"" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank."	"IiMercs [amajoni] asebenza e-Afrika yinto eqhelekileyo"" ngenxa yamashumi eminyaka yokusebenza kweekontraka ezivela eMzantsi Afrika, utshilo uJason Blazakis weqela labacingi iSoufan eliseNew York."
"The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk,"" he added."	Abantu bakwaWagner bangena kumnyango ekudala uvulelwe uhlobo lwabo,” wongeze watsho.
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.	Akukho lwazi lukhoyo lufumanekayo malunga nobungakanani beliqela okanye ubume bezimali yalo.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.	Kodwa malunga ne-Afrika, iCenter for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) eWashington ifumene ubungqina ukususela ngo2016 amajoni aseRassia e-Fortune eSudan, eSouth Sudan, eLibya, kwiCentral African Republic (CAR), iMadagascar kunye neMozambique.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.	I-Botswana, iBurundi, iChad, iComoros, iDemocratic Republic of Congo, iCongo-Brazzaville, iGuinea, iGuinea-Bissau, iNigeria kunye neZimbabwe nazo zikuluhlu lweCSIS.
"In Africa ""there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's,"" Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP."	"E-Afrika ""kukho ukuhlangana korhulumento lwamazwe amaninzi , oku kubandakanya iChina,"" u-Alexey Mukhin weCenter for Political Information eseMoscow utsho njalo  kwi-AFP."
"Every state has the right to defend its business assets,"" he added."	Wonke urhulumente unelungelo lokukhusela inzuzo yeshishini lakhe,” wongeze watsho.
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.	iWagner ayikho ngokusemthethweni, kwaye akukho kubhaliswa kwenkampani, iimbuyekezo zerhafu okanye inkcukaca zombutho ezifumanekayo.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.	Ngethuba i-EU yayifuna ukugweba eliqela ngo-2020, yayijolise kumphathi onamandla  waseRussia u-Yevgeny Prigozhin, umlingani kaMongameli u-Vladimir Putin okrokrelwa ngokukhokela iWagner.
"It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of ""hysteria"" from Moscow."	"Yabeka ezinye izohlwayo ngoDisemba kulo nyaka uphelileyo xa ukufika kwamajoni eMali kubonakala ngokuqinisekileyo - kutyholwa ""ukungabina ngqiqo"" okuvela eMoscow."
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.	Iingcali zaseNtshona zithi iikontraka zomkhosi zifakwe kwimikhosi esemthethweni yaseRussia njengee-arhente zobuntlola kunye nomkhosi, zinika inkxaso iMosco ngokuyikhanyelela.
"Their deployment to African countries aims to ""enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence"" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee."	"Ukuthunyelwa kwabo kumazwe aseAfrika kujolise ""ekubeni iRussia ikwazi ukuba... iphinde ifumane elinqanaba lempembelelo"" elatshabalala ukuwa kweSoviet Union, utshilo umphandi weCSIS uCatrina Doxsee."
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.	Ubukho bamajoni buya bukhula ngokukhawuleza ukusukela kwingqungquthela yeRussia-Afrika summit yango-2019.
"Moscow has been active ""especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence"" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university."	IMoscow ibisebenza “ingakumbi kwindawo ebikade inempembelelo zaseFrance” kwiindawo ezazisakuba yimihlaba yabo ezifana neCAR neMali, utshilo uDjallil Lounnas, umphandi kwiyunivesithi yase-Al Akhawayn yaseMorocco.
"While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue ""really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources,"" Doxsee said."	"Ngelixa iikontraka zomkhosi ngamanye amaxesha zikhulisa ukuthengiswa kwezixhobo zaseRussia, ingeniso ""incinci kakhulu xa ithelekiswa nengeniso abakwaziyo ukuyenza kwiimvumelwano zemigodi kunye nokufikelela kwimithombo yendalo,"" utshilo uDoxsee."
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.	Oko kwenza amazwe angazinzanga aneeminerali okanye ubutyebi be-hydrocarbon abathengi abaphambili - njengaseSyria apho la majoni aqala ukwaziwa kuluntu ngokubanzi.
No questions asked	Kungekho mibuzo ibuzwayo
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.	U-Lounnas uthe enye inzuzo kubathengi kukunqongophala kwengxabano kumalungelo oluntu kunye nedemokhrasi enokuthi ize namaqabane aseNtshona.
Russia has its interests.	IRussia inezinto enomdla kuzo.
"It doesn't ask questions,"" he added."	Ayibuzi mibuzo, ”wongeze watsho.
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.	Iingxelo zobundlobongela kunye nokuphathwa gadalala aphoi zibonakalisa ukuba inkululeko efanayo inokufikelela kumajoni ngokwawo.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.	Kwi-CAR, umbutho weZizwe Ezimanyeneyo uphonononga ukubulawa kwabantu abaninzi ngethuba kusebenzisana umkhosi karhulumente kunye namajoni weWagner.
"One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in ""summary executions."""	"Oyimpimpi yasemkhosini uxelele i-AFP ukuba bangaphezulu kwe-50 abantu ababhubhileyo, abanye "" bebulawa emva kokuthyolwa."""
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.	NgoLwesine, i-European Union ithe ayizukuphinda iqhubeke noqeqesho lwasemkhosini e-CAR - enqunyanyisiwe ukusukela phakathi kuDisemba - ngaphandle kokuba amajoni elizwe ayeke ukusebenzela iWagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.	Ngeloxesha iziphumo zalamajoni azisoloko zifikelela kumathemba oorhulumente ababaqeshileyo.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.	E-Libya, amajoni aseRussia afumana ilahleko enkulu kumzamo wonyaka ka-Marshal Khalifa Haftar wokoyisa ikomkhulu i-Tripoli, engazange iphumelele.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.	Kwaye eMozambique, amaRussia arhoxa ebusweni beqela lama-Jihadists e-Islamic State, ekugqibeleni boyiswa ngabo bakhuphisana noMzantsi Afrika.
"Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner ""were picked because they were the cheapest"", Doxsee said."	"Nangona bengenazo izakhono zolwimi kunye namava kule ndawo, iWagner ""yachongwa ngenxa yokuba yayiyeyona inexabiso eliphantsi"", utshilo uDoxsee."
"They didn't have what it took to succeed,"" she added, noting that ""they've had a fair few failures"" across Africa."	“Babengenako konke okudingekayo ukuze baphumelele,” wongeze watsho, ephawula ukuba “babenoko ukusilela okumbalwa” kwi-Afrika iphela.
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.	Ukuphumelela ngokupheleleyo kusenokwenzakalisa ishishini labarhwebi, eliqhuba kakuhle kwisiphithiphithi, ungquzulwano kunye nobunzima.
"If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed,"" Doxsee said."	“Ukuba ilizwe elinje ngeCAR libaqeshele ukuqeqesha imikhosi, ukubanceda kwiinzame zabo zomkhosi, kubalukelike ukuba kuyiphumeza oko ukuze baqhubeke nokuqeshwa,” utshilo uDoxsee.
"If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed."""	Ukuba ngenene bebengayenza kakuhle ngokwaneleyo ukusombulula impixano, bekungazokubakho sidingo sabo.

US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa	Ukunqongophala kwabefundisi bamaKhatholika base-US kuncitshiswe ngabaqeshwa abasuka e-Afrika
The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews.	Umfundisi uAthanasius Chidi Abanulo - esebenzisa izakhono ezihlonitshiweyo kwilizwe lakhe laseAfrika ukuze alungiselele ngokufanelekileyo emaphandleni ase-Alabama - umisela ixesha elide anokulolula iiholide zakhe zangeCawe ngokusekelwe ekubeni ngubani ohleli ezitulweni.
Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee.	Imizuzu esixhenxe yeyona ndawo imnandi kuninzi lwamarhamente amhlophe nasele esidla umhlala-phantsi azimase uMthendeleko wolwimi lwesiNgesi e-Immaculate Conception Catholic Church kwidolophu encinci yaseWedowee.
"If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people,"" he said."	“Ukuba udlulela ngaphaya koko, ulahlekelwa yingqalelo yabantu,” utshilo.
For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time. 	KwiMisa yolwimi lwesiSpanish kwiyure kamva, umfundisi owazalelwa eNigeria - omnye wabefundisi abaninzi baseAfrika okhonza e-US - uyazi ukuba angaliphindaphinda kane ixesha lakhe lokufundisa.
"The more you preach, the better for them,"" he said."	Wathi: “njekokuba esiya eshumayela, kukhona kuba ngcono kubo.
As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass.	Njengoko esuka kwesinye isikhundla saseMelika esiya kwesinye, u-Abanulo uye wafunda indlela yokwenza ubulungiseleli bakhe obulungele inkcubeko yoluntu alukhonzayo ngelixa efaka umoya welizwe lakhe kwisingqi seMisa.
"Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church,"" Abanulo said."	“Abantu baseNigeria bayakhululeka xa besiza enkonzweni,” utshilo uAbanulo.
They love to sing, they love to dance.	“Bayakuthanda ukucula, bayakuthanda ukudanisa.
The liturgy can last for two hours.	Inkonzo yonqulo inokuthatha iiyure ezimbini.
"They don't worry about that."""	Abazikhathazi ngaloo nto.
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church.	Ngexesha lakhe leminyaka eli-18 e-US, u-Abanulo uye wathabatha iindima ezahlukeneyo zobufundisi kwilizwe liphela, ebonisa imeko eqhubekayo kwinkonzo yaseMelika yamaKatolika.
As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies.	Njengoko embalwa amadoda nabasetyhini abazalelwe eMelika abangena kwiiseminari nakwiindawo zoonongendi, iidayosisi zase-US kunye namaziko obuKatolika aguqukele ekufuneni abantu bamanye amazwe ukuze bavale ezo izithuba.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica.	IDiocese of Birmingham, apho uAbanulo ekhokela amarhamente amabini, iye yandisa iphulo layo lokukhangela abefundisi kwiindawo ezinobizo lwenkolo olugqugqisayo njengeNigeria neCameroon, utshilo uBhishophu waseBirmingham uSteven Raica.
Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served.	Abefundisi baseAfrika nabo babebalulekile kwidayosisi yaseMichigan apho uRaica wayekhonza khona ngaphambili.
"They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us,"" he said."	“Babeluncedo olukhulu kuthi ukuze sikwazi ukubonelela ngobubanzi nobume bobulungiseleli esinabo kuthi,” utshilo.
Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region.	IAfrika ngowona mmandla ukhula ngokukhawuleza kwicawa yamaKatolika.
"There, the seminaries are ""fairly full,"" said the Rev."	"Khona, iiseminari ""zigcwele ngokufanelekileyo,"" watsho uMfundisi."
Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church falling numbers.	Thomas Gaunt, umlawuli weGeorgetown University Centre for Applied Research in the Apostolate, eqhuba uphando malunga necawa yamaKatolika enamanani ahlayo.
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals.	Kwahlukile e-US apho inkonzo yamaKatolika ijongene nemiqobo ekufuneni abefundisi abakhulele ekhaya emva kwamashumi eminyaka yokuhla kokuya enkonzweni kunye neziphumo ezonakalisayo zokuxhatshazwa kwabefundisi ngokwesondo.
Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith's top leadership.	Amabhinqa angamaKatolika namadoda atshatileyo ahlala ethintelwe ekubeni ngababingeleli; Iingxoxo zokuba ukususwa kwezo zithintelo kuya kunciphisa ukunqongophala kwabefundisi azizange zifumane ukuhambela phambili kwiinkokeli eziphezulu zenkolo.
"What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country,"" Gaunt said."	“Into esinayo linani elincinane kakhulu ukuqala kwiminyaka yoo-1970 labantu abangena kwiiseminari okanye kwiinkomfa kwilizwe lonke,” utshilo uGaunt.
"Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality."""	Abo bangena ngeminyaka yee-50s kunye nee-60s ngoku sele bekhulile, kwaye ke amanani amiselwa ingakumbi ngokusweleka kwabantu.
From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center.	Ukususela ku-1970 ukuya ku-2020, inani lababingeleli e-US lehla nge-60%, ngokolwazi olusuka kwiziko laseGeorgetown.
This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor.Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama.	Oku kushiye amarhamente angaphezu kwama-3,500 engenamfundisi ongumhlali. U-Abanulo wongamela amarhamente amabini kumaphandle ase-Alabama.
His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line.	ICawa yakhe eqhelekileyo iqala ngeMisa yolwimi lwesiNgesi kwi-Holy Family Catholic Church eLanett, malunga neekhilomitha ezingama-200 (125 yemiles) ukusuka eBirmingham ecaleni yemida yelizwe lase-Alabama-Georgia.
After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish.	Emva koko, uqhuba iyure ukuya emantla eWedowee, apho abhiyozela khona iMisa enye ngesiNgesi, enye ngeSpanish.
"He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories,"" said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988."	“Utsho nje ngengoma kunye neentetho zakhe ezininzi, unxulumanisa ubukhwenkwe bakhe, kwaye ndiyathanda ukuva loo mabali,” utshilo u-Amber Moosman, utitshala webanga lokuqala nobelikholwa kwi-Holy Family ukusukela ngo-1988.
"For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. ""There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that."	"KuMoosman, isimbo sika-Abanulo sokushumayela sahluke kakhulu kubefundisi awayebabone ngaphambili. ""Kwakungekho ngequbuliso, yokuba umfundisi acule, akukho nto injalo."
"… It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict,"" she said."	… kwakuthe cwaka kakhulu, kunesithethe, kungqongqo kakhulu,” utshilo.
"It's a lot different now."""	Yahluke kakhulu ngoku.
Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate paster in the Diocese of Oakland, Califonia, where his ministry focused on the fast growing Nigerian Catholic Community.	U-Abanulo wamiselwa eNigeria ngo-1990 kwaye weza e-US ngo-2003 emva kokuhlala e-Chad. Indima yakhe yokuqala yase-US yaba kuba ngumfundisi omncinci esebenza kwidayosisi yase-Oakland, eCalifornia, apho ubulungiseleli bakhe bugxile kubuKatolika baseNigeria abakhula ngokukhawuleza kuluntu.
Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.	Ukusukela ngoko, ube ngumfundisi wesibhedlele kunye nomfundisi eNashville, eTennessee, kunye nomfundisi kwiYunivesithi yaseAlabama.
Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center.	Phakathi kokunqongophala kwabefundisi eU.S, oodade bonqulo baye nabo bafumane ukuhla okuqatha, bahle nge-75% ukususela ngowe-1970, ngokutsho kweziko laseGeorgetown.
Culture shocks	Inkcubeko iyothusa
"When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, ""Where is West Virginia?"""	Ngethuba uMaria Sheri Rukwishuro waxelelwa ukuba wayethunywe kwiSisters of the Infant Jesus order eZimbabwe ukuya kusebenza eWest Virginia ukuba abe ngunongendi ongumvangeli wasemazweni, wabuza unina ophetheyo, “Iphi iWest Virginia?”
She was scared, worrying about the unknowns.	Wayesoyika, exhalabile ngoko angakwaziyo.
"What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country,"" Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004."	Ndiya kubantu abanjani? Ndingunongendi omnyama ohambele  kwilizwe elimhlophe, uRukwishuro uxelele i-Associated Press yaseClarksburg, eWest Virginia, apho ebefundisa khona imfundo yezenkolo kubafundi besikolo sikawonkewonke kunye namaKatolika ukususela oko efikile. ngo-2004.
"Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and ""rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank."	"URukwishuro ukhumbula kakuhle ukuba kwintshayelelo yakhe, kwafika intombazana encinane kuye ""yayihlikihla umnwe wayo kwiminwe yam yonke, emva koko yajonga umnwe wayo wancuma kodwa intliziyo yam yababuhlungu."
"… She thought I was dirty."" Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming."	… Wayecinga ukuba ndimdaka.” Nangona kunjalo, uRukwishuro uthi abantu abaninzi baye bandamkela ngezandla ezishushu.
She's now a U.S. citizen and says,	Ngoku ungummi wase-US kwaye uthi,
"It feels like home."""	Kuvakala ngathi kusekhaya.
One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall.	Enye yezinto ezamothusayo yokuqala zenkcubeko yaba kukuwa kwekhephu ngobusuku.
"I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world,"" she said."	“Ndakhala kakhulu. Ndandicinga ukuba sisiphelo sehlabathi,” watsho.
Now I love it.	Ngoku ndiyalithanda.
"I do my meditations to that."""	"Ndenza iingcinga zam ezinzulu kuloo."""
During their integration into American life, it is commonplace for newly arrived clergy to face culture shocks.	Ngethuba lukudityaniswa kwabo kubomi baseMelika, kuyinto eqhelekileyo ukuba abefundisi abasandul’ ukufika bajongane nomothuko kwicala lezenkcubeko.
For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation.	KuDade uChristiana Onyewuche waseNigeria, umfundisi wesibhedlele saseBoston owayesenza izithethe zokugqibela ngokufa, yayikukutshiswa kwesidumbu.
"She recalled thinking, ""Like really? … How can they burn somebody? I can't even imagine."""	"Wakhumbula ecinga, ""Nyani? ... Bangamtshisa njani umntu? Andikwazi nokuyicinga lonto."""
She came to the U.S. 18 years ago and previously served as the president of African Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, a support group for African missionaries serving in the U.S.	Weza e-US kwiminyaka eli-18 eyadlulayo kwaye ngaphambili wasebenza njengomongameli weAfrican Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, iqela lenkxaso yabavangeli basemazweni base-Afrika abakhonza e-U.S.
Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve.	UOnyewuche uthe abefundisi baseAfrika banokujamelana nocelomngeni lokunxibelelana nabantu baseMelika ababancedayo.
To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations.	Ukulungisa oku, iidayosisi ezininzi zinike uqeqesho lokuthambisa intlela abathetha ngayo, utshilo. U-Abanulo, ohambe kuqeqesho e-Oakland, uthi oko kwamnceda ukuba acothise intetho yakhe kwaye aphucule nendlela abiza ngayo.
Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes.	U-Abanulo, owafudukela e-Alabama ngo-2020, uyavuma ukuba ekuqaleni wayenexhala malunga nokungeniswa kwakhe kwamva nje, nto leyo eyayithetha ukutshintshiselana ngendima yakhe njengomfundisi waseyunivesithi etshintshelwa kumarhamente amabini asemaphandleni.
People were telling me 'Father, don't go there.	“Abantu babesithi kum ‘Mfundisi, musa ukuya apho.
"The people there are rednecks,'"" he said."	Abantu baphaya ngabantu bohlanga lweRednecks,” utshilo.
"But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, ""There are no rednecks here."	"Kodwa emva konyaka, kunye nokwamkelwa ngokufudumeleyo, uthi ngoku uxelela abahlobo bakhe, ""Akukho hlanga lweRednecks apha."

Charting the Future of China’s Infrastructure Projects in Africa After a Decade of Lending	Uwenza isakhelo ngekamva leeprojekthi zeziseko zophuhliso zaseChina e-Afrika emva kweshumi leminyaka lokuboleka
China is financing the construction of four coal-fired power plants in southern Africa, despite its climate pledge in September to quit supporting such infrastructure overseas.	I-China ixhasa ngezezimali ulwakhiwo lwemizi-mveliso emine yokuphehla umbane ngamalahle kuMazantsi e-Afrika, nangona yayenze isibhambathiso sayo malunga nesimo sezulu ngoSeptemba sokuyeka ukuxhasa oluhlobo lwezeseko zophuhliso phesheya kolwandle.
But the new facilities taking shape in South Africa and Zimbabwe are just a few of Beijings massive investments in airports, railway lines and other national infrastructure on the African continent.	Kodwa amaziko amatsha aqala ukumila eMzantsi Afrika naseZimbabwe lutyalo-mali olukhulu lwaseBeijing kwizikhululo zeenqwelomoya, imizila kaloliwe kunye nezinye iziseko zelizwe kwilizwekazi lase-Afrika.
Many countries have been eager for the investment, but mounting levels of debt over the past five years are raising doubts about the long-term prospects for more expensive infrastructure projects.	Amazwe amaninzi ebelulangazelela utyalo-mali, kodwa ukunyuka kwenqanaba lamatyala kule minyaka mihlanu idlulileyo anyusa ukuthandabuza malunga nethemba lexesha elide leeprojekthi zeziseko ezingundoqo ezisexabisweni eliphezulu.
China committed to lending African countries $153 billion from 2000-2019, but that pace of lending may be slowing down.	I-China izibophelele ekubolekeni amazwe ase-Afrika i-153 yeebhiliyoni zeedola ukusuka ngo-2000-2019, kodwa isantya sokuboleka imali sinokucotha.
Chinese loan commitments dropped by 30% in 2019 when compared with the previous year, according to the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.	Izibophelelo zemali-mboleko yaseTshayina zehle ngama-30% ngo-2019 xa kuthelekiswa nonyaka ophelileyo, ngokutsho kweNyathelo loPhando lwaseTshayina-Afrika kwiSikolo seYunivesithi yaseJohns Hopkins yeZifundo eziPhakamileyo zaMazwe ngaMazwe.
"The research looks at loan commitments which get ""disbursed to borrowers as projects are implemented."""	"Uphando lujonga izibophelelo zemali-mboleko ethi ""ihlawulwe kubaboleki njengoko kuphunyezwa iiprojekthi."""
In Zambia for example, Chinese financiers committed $10.3 billion in loans from 2000-2010.Since 2000, Zambia has only repaid some $1.2 billion to Chinese lenders.	Ngokomzekelo, eZambia, abaxhamli bezimali baseTshayina baboleka i-10.3 yeebhiliyoni zeerandi kwimali-mboleko ukususela ngowama-2000 ukuya ku-2010.
Uganda now owes China $200 million for its only international airport, fanning fears that China could seize it.	I-Uganda ngoku ityala i-China i-200 yezigidi zeedola kwisikhululo seenqwelomoya sayo kuphela, esoyikela ukuba i-China inokusithimba.
Both countries have rejected speculation in African media outlets of a Chinese takeover.	Omabini la mazwe ayikhabile intelekelelo kumajelo eendaba ase-Afrika malunga nokuthathwa kweTshayina.
Loan repayment measures  Neighboring Kenya had received a $4.5 billion loan to build a railway from Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa, and China indicates it will redo the terms after a committee of the African countrys parliament found that operating losses and debt to Chinese banks were straining taxpayers.	Amanyathelo okubuyisela imali-mboleko Ummelwane waseKenya ufumene imali-mboleko ye-4.5 yeebhiliyoni zeerandi zokwakha uloliwe osuka eNairobi usiya kwisixeko saseMombasa, kwaye iChina ibonisa ukuba iza kuphinda iphinde ilandele imigaqo emva kokuba ikomiti yepalamente yamazwe ase-Afrika ifumanise ukuba ilahleko yokusebenza kunye namatyala kwiibhanki zaseTshayina. ukucinezela abahlawuli berhafu.
Some analysts have warned that opaque lending terms means China could eventually seize infrastructure should countries struggle to meet repayments	Abanye abahlalutyi balumkisile ukuba imiqathango yokuboleka imali e-opaque ithetha ukuba i-China inokubamba iziseko zophuhliso ukuba amazwe ayasokola ukuhlawula.
"U.S. and British officials say, ""debt traps,"" where countries cannot raise enough money to repay Chinas loans, are structured to give Beijing leverage over time."	"Amagosa aseMelika kunye neBhritane athi, ""amatyala,"" apho amazwe angenako ukuqokelela imali eyaneleyo yokubuyisela imali mboleko yaseTshayina, acwangciselwe ukunika amandla iBeijing ngokuhamba kwexesha."
"Last month, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service, Richard Moore, in an interview with BBC Radio 4 said Beijing can acquire ""significant ports which have the potential to become naval facilities etcetera."""	"Kwinyanga ephelileyo, intloko yeBritish Secret Intelligence Service, uRichard Moore, kudliwano-ndlebe ne-BBC Radio 4 yathi iBeijing inokufumana ""amachweba abalulekileyo anokuba ngamaziko omkhosi wamanzi njl njl."""
Sri Lanka earlier this year passed legislation that critics say will give China control over a key deep-water port that Beijing financed.	I-Sri Lanka ekuqaleni kwalo nyaka ipasise umthetho abathi abagxeki baya kunika i-China ukulawula izibuko eliphambili lamanzi anzulu elixhaswe yiBeijing.
But that has not happened so far in Africa, where Chinese diplomats reject seizures are a part of Beijings strategy.	Kodwa oko akwenzekanga ukuza kuthi ga ngoku e-Afrika, apho oonozakuzaku baseTshayina besala ukubanjwa yinxalenye yeqhinga laseBeijing.
"Not a single project in Africa has ever been ""confiscated"" by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans."	Akukho nanye iprojekthi e-Afrika eyake yahluthwa yi-China ngenxa yokusilela ukuhlawula imali-mboleko yaseChina
"On the contrary, China firmly supports and is willing to continue our efforts to improve Africa's capacity for home-driven development,"" stated the Chinese Embassy in Uganda."	"Ngokuchasene noko, i-China ixhasa ngokuqinileyo kwaye izimisele ukuqhubeka nemigudu yethu yokuphucula amandla e-Afrika kuphuhliso oluqhutywa ekhaya, ""watsho uMzi wozakuzo waseChina eUganda."
Instead of seizing assets, Beijing will likely extend deadlines for loan repayment or rework payback terms such as interest rates, analysts told VOA.	Endaweni yokubamba i-asethi, iBeijing inokwandisa ixesha lokuhlawula imali-mboleko okanye imiqathango yokubuyisela kwakhona njengenzala, abahlalutyi baxelele iVOA.
Those measures would avert takeovers of the infrastructure itself and in turn preserve Chinas reputation in Africa where trade and lending have bested its superpower rival in dollar terms.	Loo manyathelo anokuthi athintele ukuthathwa kweziseko zophuhliso ngokwawo kwaye agcine isidima samaChina e-Afrika apho urhwebo kunye nokuboleka imali kuye kwagqwesa lowo unamandla amakhulu ngokweedola.
"China will probably ""keep kicking the can down the road"" until creditors find the means to settle the loans, Bulelani Jili, an African studies Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, told VOA."	"I-China ngokuqinisekileyo iya ""kuqhubeka ikhaba itoti ezantsi kwendlela"" de ababolekisi bafumane iindlela zokuhlawula imali-mboleko, u-Bulelani Jili, ongumfundi wase-Afrika we-Ph.D. umviwa kwiYunivesithi yaseHarvard, uxelele iVOA."
"To confiscate any assets, including minerals, would ""confirm peoples initial biases of China as a neocolonial actor,"" Jili said, and risk upsetting diplomatic ties with ""some of the few friends that China has on the global stage."""	"Ukuthimba nayiphi na impahla, kubandakanya nezimbiwa, ""kuya kuqinisekisa ukuthambekela kwabantu baseChina njengomdlali we-neocolonial,"" utshilo uJili, kunye nomngcipheko wokuphazamisa ubudlelwane bezozakuzo ""nabanye babahlobo abambalwa i-China enabo kwihlabathi."""
"From the China side, its about getting access to new possible markets and expanding both economic activity — also the diplomatic relation,"" he said."	Ukusuka kwicala laseChina, malunga nokufikelela kwiimarike ezintsha ezinokwenzeka kunye nokwandisa imisebenzi yoqoqosho - kunye nobudlelwane bozakuzo, utshilo.
Chinese loan concerns	Iinkxalabo zemali-mboleko yaseChina
China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.	I-China ikhuthaza ukuboleka imali kwi-Afrika ekufuneni imbuyekezo ephezulu kutyalo-mali kunye nodumo lwehlabathi jikelele njengomxhasi wamazwe ahluphekileyo, utshilo u-Edward Miguel, unjingalwazi we-Oxfam kwi-Environmental Resource Economics kwiYunivesithi yaseCalifornia, eBerkeley.
"It is trying to ""equal the U.S."" as a donor country, he said."	"Izama ""ukulingana ne-U.S."" njengelizwe elinikelayo, watsho."
However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes.	Nangona kunjalo, iTshayina yohlukile kwabanye ababolekisi bamazwe ngamazwe kunye nabaxhasi ikakhulu ngenxa yokungafihli nto okubangela imibuzo e-Afrika kunye naseNtshona, uMiguel ukholelwa ukuba.
"Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as ""no strings attached,"" which has been attractive for many countries."	"Ngokungafaniyo nemali-mboleko evela koorhulumente basentshona okanye imibutho ebolekisa ngemali yamazwe ngamazwe njengeBhanki yeHlabathi, efuna ukukhuselwa kwabasebenzi kunye nokusingqongileyo kwiiprojekthi ezixhaswa ngemali, uncedo lwaseChina kunye neemali-mboleko e-Afrika ziye zachazwa ngokuthi ""akukho ntambo ziqhotyoshelweyo,"" eziye zanomtsalane kumazwe amaninzi."
But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.	Kodwa amazwe ase-Afrika, ngakumbi uqoqosho luluhle ngenxa yeempembelelo ze-COVID-19, ajongene nengxaki eyandayo yokuhlawula imali mboleko, utshilo uHannah Ryder, ugxa omkhulu kwiNkqubo yeAfrika kwiziko lokucinga lase-US leSifundo seQhinga kunye neHlabathi.
"China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another,"" wrote Deborah Brautigam of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School's Meg Rithmire in a joint article."	I-China kunye namanye amazwe aya ephucuka ngakumbi ekuxoxweni omnye nomnye, wabhala uDeborah Brautigam weSikolo se-Advanced International Studies kwiYunivesithi yaseJohns Hopkins kunye neHarvard Business School's Meg Rithmire kwinqaku elidibeneyo.
Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted.	Abahlali baseDakar, eSenegal, apho i-500-personment Forum ye-China-Africa Cooperation yenzeke ngoNovemba 29-30, bafuna iziseko ezingakumbi ezixhaswa ngemali yaseTshayina kodwa ngaphandle kwamanqanaba etyala njengalawo e-1990, uRyder waphawula.
"Chinese creditors are expected to lend less money to Africa going forward and more carefully analyze the projects those loans support, experts say. Loans have already ""sobered down"" [tapered off] from a peak in 2014, Jili said."	"Ababolekisi baseTshayina kulindeleke ukuba baboleke imali encinci e-Afrika ukuya phambili kwaye bahlalutye ngononophelo ngakumbi iiprojekthi ezixhasa inkxaso-mali, iingcali zithi. Iimali-mboleko sele ""zithobile"" [zicinywe] ukusuka kwincopho ngo-2014, utshilo uJili."
Commitments for loans and other investments made at the China-Africa Cooperation meeting came to $40 billion, one-third less than the $60 billion made at the same conference in 2018.	Izibophelelo ngemali-mboleko kunye nolunye utyalo-mali olwenziwe kwintlanganiso yeNtsebenziswano ye-China ne-Afrika lufike kwiibhiliyoni ezingama-40 zeerandi, isinye esithathwini esingaphantsi kweebhiliyoni ezingama-60 zeerandi ezenziwe kwinkomfa enye ngowama-2018.
Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington.	Ababolekisi banokulinganisa imali mboleko ngokusekwe kuqikelelo lwekamva lobhubhane xa amazwe ase-Afrika enemali eninzi, utshilo uYun Sun, umlawuli wenkqubo yaseMpuma Asia kwiziko iStimson eWashington.
Another option, she said, is to ensure Chinese equity from future projects as repayment for older loans, she said in a VOA interview.	Enye inketho, uthe, kukuqinisekisa ukulingana kwamaTshayina kwiiprojekthi ezizayo njengembuyekezo yemali mboleko endala, utshilo kudliwanondlebe lweVOA.
"Its politically risky, because although its not an equity-asset swap, it smells a lot like some sort of swap, and [that] China is exploiting Africas weak position, so I dont think it will happen in the immediate future and in fact this debt restructuring is also taking quite a while,"" Sun said."	Iyingozi kwezopolitiko, kuba nangona ingelulo utshintshiselwano lwe-asethi, inuka kakhulu njengokutshintshana, kwaye [ukuba] i-China ixhaphaza isikhundla esibuthathaka saseAfrika, ngoko andicingi ukuba kuya kwenzeka kwixesha elizayo kwaye enyanisweni. olu hlengahlengiso lwetyala luthatha ixesha,” utshilo uSun.
China is becoming more confident all the while in setting up international public-private partnerships, though many African countries still worry about a repeat of the debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s when nations could not pay off debt, Ryder says in an African Business commentary.	I-China iya isiba nokuzithemba ngakumbi ngalo lonke eli xesha ekusekeni intsebenziswano phakathi kwamashishini abucala namazwe ngamazwe, nangona amazwe amaninzi ase-Afrika esaxhalabile malunga nokuphindaphinda ingxaki yamatyala ngeminyaka yoo-1980 noo-1990 xa amazwe ayengakwazi ukuhlawula amatyala, utshilo uRyder kwingxelo yoShishino lwase-Afrika. .
"International organizations ultimately wrote off that wave of unaffordable debt with conditions including opening ""their economies to international trade, liberalize their currencies and drastically cut costs"	"Imibutho yezizwe ngezizwe ekugqibeleni yalicima elatyala elingafikelelekiyo ngeemeko ezibandakanya ukuvula ""uqoqosho lwabo kurhwebo lwamazwe ngamazwe, ukukhulula iimali zabo kunye nokunciphisa kakhulu iindleko."
"in exchange for loans,"" wrote Peter Fabricius in the Institute for Security Studies."	ukutshintshiselana ngemali-mboleko,” wabhala uPeter Fabricius kwiZiko leZifundo zoKhuseleko.
"Fast forward to the present, with loans from China, African countries, Miguel said, often end up asking ""what did we agree to do"" and ""how much do we owe"" China."	"Ukukhawuleza ukuza ngoku, kunye nemali-mboleko evela e-China, amazwe ase-Afrika, uMiguel uthe, bahlala bebuza ukuba ""sivumelene ukwenza ntoni"" kwaye ""sityala malini"" e-China."
Dutch Test for New Variant After Finding 61 COVID Cases Among South Africa Passengers	IDutch yenza uvavanyo lohlobo olutsha lwesisifo emva kokufumana abantu abangama-61 abane-COVID phakathi kwabakhweli boMzantsi Afrika.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they had detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew Friday from South Africa and were now doing further tests to see whether any are infected with the new omicron variant.	Abasemagunyeni kwezempilo baseDutch bathi ngoMgqibelo bafumene abantu abayi-61 abanesifo se-COVID-19 phakathi kwabantu ababhabhe ngenqwelomoya ngolweSihlanu besuka eMzantsi Afrika kwaye ngoku besenza olunye uvavanyo ukubona ukuba ingaba bakho na abosulelwe luhlobo olutsha lwesifo i-omicron.
The cases were discovered among around 600 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on two flights Friday before the Dutch government halted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.	Ezizigulane zifunyanwe phakathi kwabakhweli abamalunga nama-600 abafike kwisikhululo seenqwelomoya i-Amsterdam Schiphol ngeenqwelomoya ezimbini ngolweSihlanu phambi kokuba urhulumente waseDutch amise iinqwelo moya ezisuka emazantsi eAfrika ngenxa yenkxalabo malunga nohlobo olutsha lwesisifo.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they also would seek to contact travelers who had arrived from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe since Monday and urge them to take a test as soon as possible.	Abaphathi bezempilo baseDutch bathi ngoMgqibelo bazakufuna ukunxibelelana nabahambi abafike bevela eMzantsi Afrika, eBotswana, e-Eswatini, eLesotho, eMozambique, eNamibia kunye naseZimbabwe ukusukela ngoMvulo kwaye babakhuthaze ukuba bathathe uvavanyo ngokukhawulezileyo.
The passengers from Friday's flights were kept separated from other travelers and those who tested positive are being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.	Abakhweli abavela kwiinqwelomoya zangoLwesihlanu bagcinwe bohlukene nabanye abahambi kwaye abo bafunyaniswe benaso esisifo bagcinwe bodwa kwihotele ekufutshane nesikhululo seenqwelomoya.
A spokesperson for the health ministry said it would not be known until later Saturday whether any of passengers are infected with the new variant.	Isithethi senkonzo yezempilo sithe ayizukwaziwa de kube nguMgqibelo ukuba ingaba kukhona na abakhweli abosulelekileyo kolu hlobo lutsha lwesisifo.
A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the airline was trying to determine what rules were in place as of Friday morning to prevent people with COVID-19 infections from boarding the flights, which departed from Cape Town and Johannesburg.	Isithethi se-KLM, ingalo yaseDutch ye-Air France, ithe inkampani yeenqwelomoya ibizama ukufumanisa ukuba yeyiphi na imigaqo ekhoyo ukusukela ngentsasa yangoLwesihlanu ukuthintela abantu abosulelekileyo yi-COVID-19 ukuba bakhwele kwiinqwelomoya, ezisuka eKapa kunye naseRhawutini.
"Rules on the company's website said passengers had to present a negative COVID-19 ""rapid antigen"" test result taken 24 hours before departure but were not required to show proof of vaccination."	"Imithetho kwiwebhusayithi yenkampani yathi abakhweli kufuneka baveze iziphumo zovavanyo lwe-COVID-19  iziphumo ""zerapid antigen"" ethathwe kwiiyure ezingama-24 ngaphambi kokuhamba kodwa bekungafuneki ukuba babonise ubungqina bogonyo."
Really Weird'  Paula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.	Iyamangalisa ngokwenene' uPaula Zimmerman, umfoti waseDutch ubuye kutyelelo losapho lwakhe eMzantsi Afrika ngentsasa yangoLwesihlanu, uthe imeko yabakhweli kwiinqwelomoya yayinesiphithiphithi, njengoko babegcinwe belindile kwindlela yeenqwelomoya nakwisikhululo sazo iiyure.
Zimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 a.m., almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam, but said she then found out she was standing right next to a man who knew he had tested positive for an infection.	UZimmerman waxelelwa ukuba ufunyaniswe engenaso esisifo ngentsimbi yesi-4 kusasa, phantse kwiiyure ezili-18 emva kokufika e-Amsterdam, kodwa wathi emva koko wafumanisa ukuba wayemi ecaleni kwendoda eyayisazi ukuba yona inaso esisifo.
It was really weird.	“Yayingummangaliso ngokwenene.
There was no coordination.	Kwakungekho kulungelelaniswa.
"There were too few people and there really wasnt anybody who took control."""	"Kwakukho abantu abambalwa kwaye kungekho mntu ulawulayo."""
Having spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said.	Emveni kokuchitha iiyure kwinqwelomoya ekusenokwenzeka ukuba inabakhweli abaninzi abosulelekileyo kwenza uZimmerman wanexhala iintsuku, utshilo.
Ive been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days.	“Ndixelelwe ukuba balindele ukuba baninzi abantu abaza kufunyanwa banaso esisifo emva kweentsuku ezintlanu.
"It's a little scary the idea that you've been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive."""	Inendawo eyothusayo into yokuba ubukwinqwelomoya enabantu abaninzi abafunyaniswe ukuba banaso esisifo.”
The Dutch flight ban does not mean that all flights from southern Africa to the Netherlands are halted, as Dutch citizens are allowed to return home, while EU citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.	Ukuvalwa kwenqwelomoya zaseDutch akuthethi ukuba zonke iinqwelomoya ezisuka eMazantsi e-Afrika zisiya eNetherlands ziyanqunyanyiswa, njengoko abemi baseDutchi bevumelekile ukuba babuyele ekhaya, ngelixa abemi be-EU bevumelekile ukuba bangene kumazwe abo.
Medical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel.	Abasebenzi bezempilo, abasebenzi beenqwelo moya kunye nabantu abanezidingo ezicinezelayo basavumelekile ukuba bahambe.
KLM will continue flights to the region, but travelers need to stay in quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.	I-KLM iya kuqhubekeka ineenqwelomoya eziya kulo mmandla, kodwa abahambi kunyanzelekile ukuba bahlale bodwa kangangeentsuku ezintlanu xa befika eNetherlands.
The new variant has been detected just as many European countries are grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases.	Uhlobo olutsha lwesisifo lufunyaniswe ngethuba amazwe amaninzi aseYurophu exakene nokwenyuka kwamanani abantu abane-coronavirus.
The Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its health care system.	NgoLwesihlanu urhulumente waseDutch ubhengeze ukuvalwa ebusuku kweebhari, iivenkile zokutyela kunye neevenkile ezininzi njengoko ezama ukunqanda irekhodi elophula irekhodi lwabantu abanesifo i-COVID-19 egxobha inkqubo yakhe yezempilo.

Amagosa e-EU athi akukabikho sigqibo senziweyo malunga namanye amazwe akwezinye iindawo zehlabathi apho kufunyenwe khona oluhlobo lwesisifo, amazwe aquka iHong Kong, Israel kunye neBelgium, ilizwe le-EU.
Global alarm	Uloyiko lwehlabathi
The new coronavirus variant, first detected in South Africa, has caused global alarm as researchers seek to find out if it is vaccine-resistant.	Uhlobo lutsha lwe-coronavirus, olufunyenwe kuqala eMzantsi Afrika, lubangele uloyiko ehlabathini njengoko abaphandi befuna ukufumanisa ukuba ingaba luyanyangeka na ngogonyo.
Marc Van Ranst, the virologist who detected the new variant in Belgium, told Reuters it was more likely the infected woman had contracted the variant in Belgium rather than while traveling outside Europe.	UMarc Van Ranst, ugqirha wentsholongwane ofumene uhlobo olutsha eBelgium, uxelele iReuters ukuba kunokwenzeka ukuba lo wasethyini usuleleke loluhlobo lutsha lwesisifo eBelgium kunokuba usuleleke nethuba ehambele ngaphandle kweYurophu.
She had been in Egypt earlier in November but developed symptoms only 11 days after her return to Belgium. She is not vaccinated.	Ebehambele e-Egypt ekuqaleni kukaNovemba kodwa waba neempawu kuphela kwiintsuku ezili-11 emva kokubuyela kwakhe eBelgium. Akagonywanga.

Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change	Iingcali zokusingqongileyo zaseZimbabwe zifuna ngaphezulu malunga nentetho ngoTshintsho lweMozulu
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change.	Iingcali zokusingqungileyo eZimbabwe ziphendule ngomsindo kwintetho kaMongameli uEmmerson Mnangagwa kwinkomfa ye-COP26, apho athembise ngokulwa kukarhulumente wakhe esilwela ngokuchaseneyo nokugawulwa kwamahlathi kunye nokutshintsha kwemozulu.
Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out.	Iingcali zokusingqungileyo zithi urhulumente uxakekile enikezela ngomhlaba kwiinkampani, ingakumbi ezamaTshayina, ukuba zembe amalahle ukuze zisebenzise amandla, nto leyo i-COP26 ifuna apheliswe.
Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere.	NgoLwesibini eSkotlani, uMongameli uEmmerson Mnangagwa uthethe kwiNkomfa yeZizwe eziManyeneyo yoTshintsho lweMozulu ka-2021, eyaziwa ngokuba yiCOP26, apho ebongoze amazwe aphuhlileyo ukuba ahlawule ngokubangela ukufudumala kwehlabathi ngokukhupha iigesi emoyeni.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions.	Uthe amazwe asaphuhlayo afana neZimbabwe ahlawula iziphumo zoko kukhutshwa komoya ongcolileyo.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change.	Ukwathembise ngentsebenziswano lelizwe lakhe kumlo ochasene nokutshintsha kwemozulu.
Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030.	“IZimbabwe iye yalihlaziya igalelo layo elimiselwe kuzwelonke, ukuzimisela okunemiqathango engama-40% ngomntu ngamnye ekujoliswe ekunciphiseni kokukhutshwa kwegesi engcolisayo ngo-2030.
"Comprehensive strategies are being implemented towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience across all sectors of our economy,"" Mnangagwa said."	Amaqhinga abanzi ayaphunyezwa ekumiseleni uhlengahlengiso lokutshintsha kwemozulu kunye nokomelela kuwo onke amacandelo oqoqosho lwethu, utshilo uMnangagwa.
This comes at a time when environmentalists in Zimbabwe are asking the government to revoke an exploration license recently awarded to a Chinese company to mine coal for energy use.	Oku kuvele kanye xa iingcaki zokusingqungileyo eZimbabwe zicela urhulumente ukuba arhoxise iphepha-mvume lokuhlola elinikwe inkampani yase China ukuba imbe amalahle ukuze isebenzise amandla awo.
The Center for Natural Resource Governance is one of the organizations opposing the license.	Iziko loLawulo lweMithombo yeNdalo ngomnye wemibutho ephikisana nokunikezelwa kweli phepha-mvume.
The group promotes green energy, and fears that exploration for coal will cause greater deforestation.	Eli qela likhuthaza amandla ohlaza, kwaye liloyiko lokuba ukusetyenziswa  kwamalahle kubangela ukutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi okugqithisileyo.
Henry Nyapokoto, the program manager for the group, said Mnangagwas comments run contrary to what he sees going on.	UHenry Nyapokoto, umphathi wenkqubo yeli qela, uthe izimvo zikaMnangagwa zihamba ngokuchasene noko akubona kusenzeka.
But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy.	“Kodwa urhulumente ebekwimo esebenza ngokugqithisileyo ukukhuthaza imigodi kuyo yonke indawo ukuze kufikelelwe kuqoqosho lwemigodi yeebhiliyoni eziyi-12 zeedola.
In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster.	Kunjalo nje, ayenzi ngqiqo yendalo ukuba iZimbabwe ifumane uqoqosho lweedola ezili-12 leebhiliyoni ezisekelwe kwiindlela ezimbi zemveliso, ukusetyenziswa okungalunganga, okushiya kusetyesiswe indawo enkulu yendalo okanye ilifa lentlekele yendalo.
"We all understand that mining comes with destruction of forests that serves as carbon sinks and habitat for wildlife,"" Nyapokoto said."	Sonke siyaqonda ukuba imigodi iza nokutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi asebenza njengendawo yokucoca umoya nendawo apho izilwanyana zasendle zihlala khona,” utshilo uNyapokoto.
Nyapokoto added that Zimbabwe was exploring oil and gas on its northeast border with Zambia, another project that could lead to deforestation.	UNyapokoto wongeze wathi iZimbabwe ihlola ioyile negesi kumda wayo osemntla-mpuma neZambia, enye yezinto enokukhokelela ekutshatyalalisweni kwamahlathi.
Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems.	Ngaphandle kwempembelelo yeoyile kunye negesi kukufudumala kwehlabathi, kuza kubakho (a) isiphumo esicacileyo, esithe ngqo sale migodi yeoli kunye negesi kuluntu okanye kwinqkubo yendalo.
Land will be cleared for mining and other infrastructure that is going to support that mining.	Umhlaba uya kucocwa ukwenzela imigodi nezinye iziseko zophuhliso eziza kuxhasa loo migodi.
"That is contrary to the greening of the economy that they are talking about in Glasgow,"" Nyapokoto said."	Oku kuchasene nokwenza luhlaza uqoqosho abathetha ngalo eGlasgow,” utshilo uNyapokoto.
He said Zimbabwe was in the top 10 of countries of deforestation, with about 300,000 hectares of forests destroyed annually.	Uthe iZimbabwe ikwishumi lamazwe aphambili ekutshatyalalwisweni kwamahlathi, malunga neehektare ezingama-300,000 zamahlathi ezithi zigawulwe ngonyaka.
But Byron Zamasiya of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association says Mnangagwa was genuine in his COP26 address about fighting deforestation caused by need for energy.	Kodwa uByron Zamasiya weZimbabwe Environmental Law Association uthi uMnangagwa wayenyanisekile kwintetho yakhe yeCOP26 malunga nokulwa ukugawulwa kwamahlathi okubangelwa sisidingo sokusebenzisa amandla ombane.
So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe.	“Kungoko ke, umba wokulwa ukutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi yeyona nto iphambili ekufuneka inikwe iingqwalasela malunga nokukhutshwa kwegreenhouse gas eZimbabwe.
The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming.	Imithi isebenza njengendawo yokucoca umoya njengoko ifunxa icarbon dioxide, eyona nto ingunobangela wokufudumala kwehlabathi.
What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation.

South Africa's Zuma to Pursue Private Prosecution Against Prosecutor	UZuma woMzantsi Afrika uzakuqhuba uTshutshiso lwaBucala ngakuMtshutshisi
Former South African President Jacob Zuma is pursuing private prosecution proceedings to remove the lead prosecutor in an arms deal corruption trial after failed legal challenges, his foundation said on Sunday.	Owayesakuba ngumongameli weli loMzantsi Afrika uJacob Zuma uqhuba iinkqubo zokutshutshisa ukususa umtshutshisi okhokelayo kwityala lobuqhophololo emva kokungaphumeleli kwezomthetho, isiseko sakhe satsho ngeCawe.
Last month the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) torpedoed Zuma's latest bid to have lead prosecutor Billy Downer taken off the case after accusing him of bias and leaking of confidential information to a journalist in contravention of the national prosecution act, among other complaints.	Kwinyanga ephelileyo iNkundla ePhakamileyo yeziBheno (SCA) yasikhaba isicelo sikaZuma sokuba umtshutshisi okhokelayo uBilly Downer alishenxise eli tyala emva kokumtyhola ngokukheth’ icala kunye nokupapasha ulwazi oluyimfihlo kwintatheli ngokuchasene nomthetho wesizwe wotshutshiso, phakathi kwezinye izikhalazo.
The SCA dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that there is no reasonable prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.	I-SCA isikhabile isicelo semvume yokubhena ngesizathu sokuba akukho themba libambekayo lokuphumelela kwaye asikho esinye isizathu esibambekayo sokuba kutheni isibheno kufuneka simanyelwe.
"The spokesman of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, Mzwanele Manyi told a press briefing that Zuma's instructions to his legal team to institute private prosecution ""will now be put into operation in the next few days."""	Isithethi seJacob Zuma Foundation, uMzwanele Manyi, uxelele indibano yonondaba ukuba imiyalelo kaZuma kwiqela lakhe lezomthetho ukuba liqalise ukutshutshisa labucala “iza kuqala ukusebenza kwezi ntsuku zimbalwa zizayo.
He also said Zuma's legal team has filed a reconsideration application to the president of the SCA, a petition to hear the appeal.	Ukwathe igqiza lamagqwetha kaZuma lifake isicelo sokuphinda siqwalaselwe kumongameli weSCA, uxwebhu lwezikhalazo zokumamela isibheno.
Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s.	UZuma, owagxothwayo kumbutho olawulayo we-African National Congress ngo-2018 emva kweminyaka engamashumi amabini engumongameli, uzikhanyelanga izityholo zobuqhophololo, ukurhwaphiliza imali kunye norhwaphilizo kwityala ekudala ligquba malunga nesivumelwano sezixhobo ezixabisa iibhiliyoni ezimbini zeerandi kwiminyaka yoo-1990.
The deal case has dogged Zuma since he was sacked as deputy president of the country in 2005. He said he was the victim of a political witch-hunt.	Ityala lesivumelwano limphethe kakubi uZuma ukusukela oko wagxothwa njengosekela mongameli welizwe ngo-2005. Wathi wayelixhoba lokuzingelwa kwamagqwirha kwezopolitiko.
On Monday the long-delayed trail is set to get underway and Zuma will be present in court.	NgoMvulo lo ukuxoxwa kwetyala okusele kulibazisile kuzokuqala kwaye uZuma uzakube ekhona enkundleni.
"Manyi said Zuma, who turns 80 on Tuesday, is applying for a postponement because ""it is very clear that the conditions for a fair trail are non-existent."""	UManyi uthe uZuma, nogqiba iminyaka engamashumi asibhozo ubudala ngoLwesibini, ufaka isicelo sokumiswa ngenxa yokuba “kucace gca ukuba iimeko zokuxoxwa kwetyala ngokufanelekileyo azikho.
On Monday his team will also respond to the supplementary affidavit served by the National Prosecution Authority where they seek to introduce new evidence in the trial.	NgoMvulo iqela lakhe liza kuphendula kwakhona kwingxelo efungelweyo eyongeziweyo enikwe nguGunyaziwe woTshutshiso weSizwe apho bafuna ukwazisa ubungqina obutsha kwityala.
"All His Excellency President Zuma really wants is his day in court, in a fair trial and certainly not in a forum which is being rigged by the State,"" Manyi said."	“Eyona nto ifunwa nguMongameli uZuma yimini yakhe enkundleni, kuxoxwe ngokungenamkhethe hayi kwiqonga eliqhathwa nguRhulumente,” utshilo uManyi.
South Africa’s Neutral Stance on Russia Risks International Ties: Analysts	UBume boMzantsi Afrika bokungathathi cala kwiRussia bubeka umngcipheko wobudlelwane babazwe ngamazwe: abahlalutyi
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday defended his neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for talks — not condemnation.	Umongameli woMzantsi Afrika uCyril Ramaphosa ngoMvulo ukhusele ukungathabathi cala kwakhe kuhlaselo lwase-Ukraine yiRussia, ememelela iingxoxo- hayi ukugxeka.
Critics have blasted the government for failing to support Ukraine against its neighbor.	Abagxeki baye bagxeka urhulumente ngokusilela ukuxhasa iUkraine ngokuchasene nommelwane wayo.
Analysts say South Africa is allowing historic political and economic ties with Moscow to risk relations with the rest of the world.	Abahlalutyi bathi uMzantsi Afrika uvumela ubudlelwane bezopolitiko nezoqoqosho neMoscow bubeke emngciphekweni ubudlelwane nehlabathi liphela.
Negotiation rather than weapons or economic pressure is the mechanism Ramaphosa would like to see used to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict.	Uthethathethwano endaweni yezixhobo okanye uxinzelelo lwezoqoqosho yindlela uRamaphosa angathanda ukuyibona isetyenziselwa ukulungisa impixano yaseRussia-neUkraine.
Ramaphosas unwavering stance overruled an earlier call by the countrys international relations department for Russia to withdraw its forces.	Ukungaguquguquki kukaRamaphosa kwasikhaba isicelo sangaphambili sesebe lezobudlelwane bezizwe ngezizwe sokuba iRussia mayirhoxise imikhosi yayo.
Leaza Jernberg is a Johannesburg-based independent researcher and consultant on diplomacy.	ULeaza Jernberg ngumphandi ozimeleyo oseRhawutini kunye nomcebisi kwidiplomacy.
The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, [which] is largely the diplomat for South Africa, their initial instinct was to say, ‘Well, this was not acceptable.	“ISebe lezobudlelwane bamazwe ngamazwe nentsebenziswano, ngonozakuzaku boMzantsi Afrika ubukhulu becala, ithuku labo lakuqala yayikukuthi, ‘Kaloku, le ayamkelekanga.
"And that was kind of pulled back by the president who I think has this concern about allies and Russian and what this looks like,"" Jernberg said."	Kwaye loo nto yayihlehlisiwe ngumongameli endicinga ukuba unenkxalabo malunga namahlakani kunye neRussia kwaye ijongeka njani le nto, utshilo uJernberg.
"So even within South Africa, South Africa's position is very contested, even within government."""	Ngoko nalapha eMzantsi Afrika, isikhundla soMzantsi Afrika sixabene kakhulu, nangaphakathi kurhulumente.
South Africas ties to Russia stretch back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union gave support to anti-apartheid freedom fighters.	Amakhonkco oMzantsi Afrika kunye neRussia asuka ukusukela kwiminyaka yoo-1960 xa iSoviet Union yanika inkxaso kubalweli benkululeko ababechasene nocalucalulo.
In subsequent years, politicians, including those from the ruling party, the African National Congress, maintained close ties with Russia.	Kwiminyaka eyalandelayo, abezopolitiko, kuquka abo bombutho olawulayo, iAfrican National Congress, bagcina ubuhlobo obusenyongweni neRassia.
Which is why analysts said its no surprise that a foundation headed by former president Jacob Zuma has voiced support for Russias Vladimir Putin.	Kungoko abahlalutyi besithi ayothusi into yokuba isiseko esikhokelwa ngowayesakuba ngumongameli uJacob Zuma sivakalise inkxaso kuVladimir Putin waseRussia.
Richard Calland is a public law professor at the University of Cape Town.	URichard Calland yinjingalwazi yezomthetho kwiYunivesithi yaseKapa.
"He [Putin] had a very close relationship with our former President, Jacob Zuma,"" Calland said."	“U[Putin] ebenobudlelwane obusondeleyo nowayesakuba nguMongameli wethu, uJacob Zuma,” utshilo uCallland.
It was a corrupt relationship.	“Yayibubudlelwane borhwaphilizo.
It fueled an illegal in the end, the court said, illegal procurement of Russian nuclear power, which was stopped by the courts.	Kwaphembelela into engekho mthethweni ekugqibeleni, inkundla yathi, ukuthengwa ngokungekho mthethweni kwamandla enyukliya aseRassia, okwayekiswa ziinkundla.
And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa.	Kwaye ndinoloyiko lokuba oko kuphazamisana nezimo ezithile zezopolitiko eMzantsi Afrika.
"But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken."""	Kodwa andikholelwa ukuba yayisisizathu esithe ngqo kwisikhundla esithathwe nguMzantsi Afrika.
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts.	Endaweni yoko, uCallland uthi, amagosa oMzantsi Afrika alandela nje umgangatho welizwe kwimilo yamazwe angaphandle.
"I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment,"" Calland said."	“Ndibazi kakuhle kwaye ndinxibelelana kakhulu namagosa aphezulu ozakuzo eMzantsi Afrika, kwaye bangene nzulu kwelisiko lokungakhethi cala,” utshilo uCallland.
Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak.	Ingxoxo yezopolitiko ligama labo eliphakathi, xa sesithetha.
"And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue."""	Kwaye ndicinga ukuba kule, bebefuna ukugcina olu hlobo lwesikhundla esingakhethi cala ukuze bakhuthaze loo ngxoxo.
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.	Enye into edlala indima kukuma kwelizwe kumanyano lwezoqoqosho, iBRICS, equka iBrazil, Russia, India, China kunye noMzantsi Afrika.
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China.	Abahlalutyi bathi uMzantsi Afrika usenokuba uzama ukugcina ubudlelwane borhwebo neRussia neChina.
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive.	Kodwa ingcaphephe kubudlelwane bamazwe aphesheya uJernberg uthe ukuma akunamveliso.
"In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse,"" Jernberg said."	Xa kunjalo, sixhasa ihashe elingelilo,” utshilo uJernberg.
"When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest."""	Xa ujonga i-EU, iEuropien Union njengebhloko, urhwebo oludityanisiweyo loMzantsi Afrika kwiManyano yaseYurophu ngokwenene lukhulu kakhulu. I-United States naphakathi, kunye neYurophu, ngokwenene inomdla omkhulu wezoqoqosho.
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future.	Nokuba zithini na iinjongo, oko kushiye amazwe aseNtshona abambisene  neiUkraine edanile, kwaye iingcaphephe zilumkisa ngelithi kusenokubakho ifuthe kuMzantsi Afrika kwixesha elizayo.
Ina Gouws is a political science lecturer at South Africas University of the Free State.	U-Ina Gouws ngumhlohli wenzululwazi yezopolitiko kwiYunivesithi yoMzantsi Afrika yaseFreyistata.
"These kinds of things down the road, become problematic,"" Gouws said."	“Ezi ntlobo zezinto ekuhambeni kwexesha, ziba yingxaki,” utshilo uGouws.
"If you don't display that kind of cooperation and sound thinking, and firm condemnation when a country does something like this, down the road, it bites you when you need support from the international community."""	Ukuba awubonisi olo hlobo lwentsebenziswano kunye nokucinga okuvakalayo, kunye nokugwetywa okuqinileyo xa ilizwe lenza into enje, ekuhambeni kwexesha, iyakuluma xa udinga inkxaso evela kuluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe.
While the ramifications for South Africa remain uncertain, experts agree its unlikely the country will change its position any time soon.	Ngelixa iziphumo zoMzantsi Afrika zisahleli zingaqinisekanga, iingcali ziyavuma ukuba akunakufane kwenzeke ukuba elilizwe litshintshe imeko yalo okwangoku.

Americans agree on this much: They are disgusted with politics.	Abemi basemelika bavumelana ngoku:Bakruqukile zezopolitiko.
They look toward Washington and see a broken federal government.	Bathi bokujonga eWashington, babone urhulumente weFederal owophukileyo.

Yet Americans say they still believe in America, the experiment in democracy that the founders described as a place where the government should protect the rights of ordinary people to life, liberty and the persuit of hapiness.	Kodwa abemi baseMelika bathi basakholelwa kwiMelika, indlela abaseki belizwe abalicacisa ngalo ilinge ledemokhrasi njengendawo apho urhulumente kunyazeleke ukuba akhusele amalungelo oluntu, inkululeko kwakunye nokufuna ulonwabo.
There's something at the core of America they long for, even if it's hard to define and seems distant in 2016.	Ikhona into kumbindi weMelika abayilangazelelayo, nokuba kunzima ukuyicacisa kwaye ibonakala ikude ngo-2016.

But what does that even mean?	kodwa oku kuthetha ukuthini?

The responses were as different as Americans themselves, yet a theme emerged: Compared to other nations, the United States is at least good, probably even great.	Iimpendulo zazohlukile njengabemi beMelika, kodwa kwavela into enye phambili: Xa ithelekiswa nezinye izizwe, iUnited Statea noko ilungile, mhlawumbi ibalasele

It could be a lot better if the politicians weren't fighting each other all the time ...,'' said Rodney Kimball, a 74-year-old stove dealer in West Bethel, Maine. 	"Bekungaba ngcono kakhulu ukuba abezopolitiko bebengwalisani amaxesha amaninzi...""utshilo uRodney Kimbali, umthengisi wezitovu oneminyaka engama-74 waseWest Bethel, eMeine."
America is divided by political party, choice of media, income, gender, race or ethnic group, religious faith (or not), generation, geography and general outlook on the country's future.	IMelika yahlulwe ngezopolitiko, ukhetho lwamajelo eendaba, imivuzo, isini, ibala okanye ubuhlanga, inkolo (ukungakholwa) izizukulwana, ummandla kunye neembono jikelele ngekamva lelizwe.
Pundits have proclaimed the electorate angry and wondered if the nation can ever recover the sense of unity experienced in the immediate aftermath of the al-Qaida attacks that took place 15 years ago this September. 	Iingcali zivakalise ukuba abavoti banomsindo kwaye banemibuzo yokuba isizwe siyakubuye siphinde simanyane emva kweziphumo ezikhawulezileyo zohlaselo lwe al-Qaida ezakugqiba malunga neminyaka eli-15 yenzekayo kuloSeptemba.
The current dearth of confidence in the nation's politics and government is striking.	Oku kufa kokuzithemba kwezopolitiko norhulumento lwesisizwe luyamangalisa.
I think that America as an idea is one of the most beautiful ideas that the world has ever known. 	Ndicinga ukuba iMelika njengembono yenye yeembono ezintle eyakhe yabonwa lihlabathi.
I think that American opportunity and ingenuity has built some of the most incredible technologies and innovations today,'' said Allene Swanson, 22, of Chicago.	"Ndicinga ukuba ithuba laseMelika kunye nobuchule bakhe ezona zinto zakhe zaphezulu zetekhnology kunye nezinto ezintsa namhlanje."" utshilo uAllene Swanson, oneminyaka engama-22 waseChicago."
For some, real success has always seemed out of reach.	Kwabanye, impumelelo yokwenyani ibisoloko ibonakala njengento engafikilelekiyo.
