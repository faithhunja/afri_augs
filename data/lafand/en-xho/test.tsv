"U-Amnesty uncome abantu baseTanzania ngokususa ukuvalwa kwephephandaba ngoFebruwari kodwa wathi urhulumente ""kufuneka enze okungakumbi ukuqinisekisa inkululeko yeendaba ukuya phambili."""
"A free press, Ebole told VOA, ""would mean Tanzanians looking into the future with most hope in terms of expressing themselves and getting information – and information that would benefit them in all aspects of their lives, whether its economic, social and cultural."""	"Umshicileli wamahhala, u-Ebole uxelele i-VOA, ""kuya kuthetha ukuba amaTanzania ajonge kwixesha elizayo ngethemba elikhulu malunga nokuzibonakalisa kunye nokufumana ulwazi - kunye nolwazi oluya kubazuzisa kuzo zonke iinkalo zobomi babo, nokuba yeyoqoqosho, intlalontle kunye nenkcubeko."""
"We are somehow optimistic, Melo said of journalists and rights activists. But, he cautioned, ""the laws are still there, really draconian laws."	“Ngandlela ithile sinethemba,” utshilo uMelo ngeentatheli nabalwela amalungelo. Kodwa, ulumkise ngelithi, “imithetho isekhona, imithetho engqongqo ngokwenene.

We must reach a place that we all agree that we need to protect the interests of media and the people as well.	“Kufuneka sifikelele kwindawo apho sonke sivumelana ukuba kufuneka sikhusele umdla wamajelo eendaba nabantu ngokunjalo.

South Africa Urges Africa’s First COVID-19 Vaccine Plant to Keep Its Doors Open	UMzantsi Afrika Ubongoza iZiko lokuqala lase-Afrika lokugonya i-COVID-19 ukuba ligcine iingcango zaso zivulekile
South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open.	Amagosa ezempilo eMzantsi Afrika abongoza umenzi wesitofu sokugonya i-COVID-19 i-Aspen ukuba igcine isityalo sayo sivulekile kwiphondo leMpuma Koloni.
This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.	Oku kulandela inqaku leReuters licaphula umlawuli omkhulu wakwa-Aspens esithi kungafuneka bavale njengoko kungakhange kubekho zi-odolo zesitofu sabo sogonyo se-COVID.
A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.	Inkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika ephantsi kwenkampani enkulu samayeza i-Aspen yenze isivumelwano nenkampani yaseMelika iJohnson & Johnson ngoMatshi yokupakisha, ixabiso, ukuthengisa kunye nokusasaza isitofu sayo sokugonya e-Afrika.
This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.	Esi sitofu sathiywa ngokutsha njenge-Aspenovax.
The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.	Eli nyathelo liye lanconywa ngabaninzi njengoko bekukho inkxalabo enkulu malunga nokuxhomekeka kweAfrika kumayeza ogonyo asuka kumazwe angaphandle ebesoloko eneendleko kwaye ngamanye amaxesha enqongophele.
But there have been no orders for Aspenovax.	Kodwa akukhange kubekho ziodolo ze-Aspenovax.
South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.	Isithethi seSebe lezeMpilo kuzwelonke eMzantsi Afrika uFoster Mohale uthe ukunqongophala kwee-odolo kungenxa yamazinga aphantsi okugonya kungekuphela nje ekhaya, kodwa kwihlabathi jikelele.
Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. 	“Ukuthandabuza kugonyo yenye yezinto ezinegalelo kula mazinga aphantsi ogonyo okanye imfuno yogonyo engaphezulu echaphazela imveliso.
Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.	Kuba ngokucacileyo siyaqonda ukuba abakwishishini, abakwazi ukuqhubeka bevelisa izitofu zokugonya xa besazi ukuba imfuno yogonyo iphantsi kakhulu.
"So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them,"" he said."	Ke, siyayiqonda imeko abakuyo, kwaye siyavelana nabo,” utshilo.
Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.	UMohale uthe okwangoku, uMzantsi Afrika unezitofu ezaneleyo.
He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired.	Wongeza ngelithi ngoMatshi, amayeza ogonyo ayi-100,000 aphelelwe lixesha.
And more are due to expire in June and July.	Kwaye ngaphezulu kulindeleke ukuba ziphelelwe ngoJuni nangoJulayi.
However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.	Nangona kunjalo, uthe isityalo sokugonya i-Aspens sibalulekile kuba akukho mntu waziyo ukuba ikamva lisiphathele ntoni.
We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now. 	Siza kuzama ukuthetha nabo ukuba bangasingxameli isigqibo sabo ngokuchanekileyo kuba silindele izazinzulu zethu, iingcali zethu zezifo, ukuba iliza lesihlanu lingabetha ilizwe loMzantsi Afrika ngexesha lasebusika elisele kwiiveki ezimbalwa ukusuka ngoku.
"As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days,"" he said."	Njengoko ubona inani lezigulana ze-COVID-19 zemihla ngemihla zinyuka kwezi ntsuku zisixhenxe zidlulileyo,”utshilo.
Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry.	Unjingalwazi uPetro Terblanche, ongumlawuli wenkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika, i-Afrigen, ethe kwilizwekazi lokuqala yenza isitofu sokugonya i-mRNA COVID isebenzisa Idatha yeModernas - uthe imeko yase-Aspen yintlekele kwishishini.
This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. 	“Oku kubonisa kwakhona indlela ekubaluleke ngayo ukuba eli lizwekazi lijonge uhlengahlengiso lomgaqo-nkqubo.
This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies.	Oku kumalunga nendlela esiza kuqinisekisa ngayo ukuba sinikezela ngokukhethekileyo kwiinkampani zasekhaya.
How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?	Siza kuqinisekisa njani ukuba sivelisa indawo yokuthengisa kunye ne-nkqubo yendalo eya kuthatha umthamo wasekhaya?
"Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security,"" said Terblanche."	Ngaphandle koko, asiyi kuba nomthamo wasekhaya ngendlela ezinzileyo kwaye siyakufumana ubhubhane olandelayo sibe singalungiselelanga, kwaye asiyi kuba nokhuseleko lwezempilo, ”utshilo uTerblanche.
She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines.	Ukholelwa ukuba imali kufuneka ifakwe ekufundiseni abantu ngokubaluleka kwezitofu zokugonya.
We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. 	“Kufuneka siqinisekise ukuba sikwabeka iinzame zokuxhasa ugonyo.
Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated.	Kaloku ngoku sine-17% yelizwekazi eligonyiweyo.
"We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic,"" she said."	Kufuneka sibenze bafikelele kwi-40% ubuncinci ukuqinisekisa ukuba siwubamba ngokupheleleyo lo bhubhani, utshilo.
Mohale was unable to say when the Health Department would be meeting with Aspens executives.	UMohale akakwazanga ukuchaza ukuba iSebe lezeMpilo lizakuhlangana nini nabaphathi baseAspens.
Disinformation, Censorship, Trigger Global Retreat of Press Freedom.	I-Disinformation, i-Censorship, i-Trigger i-Global Retreat ye-Press Freedom.
Led by the Kremlin's example, a global rise in disinformation and propaganda is having a disastrous effect on independent news around the world, a new report finds.	Ikhokelwa ngumzekelo we-Kremlin, ukunyuka kolwazi olungelulo kunye ne-propaganda ehlabathini kunempembelelo embi kwiindaba ezizimeleyo kwihlabathi jikelele, ngokwengxelo yeendaba.
In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed vastly to the spread of fake news and propaganda.	Kwi-World Press Freedom Index ka-2022 ekhutshwe ngoLwesibini, iiNtatheli ezisekwe eParis ngaphandle kwemida (RSF) zathi ukuhlasela kweRussia eUkraine kube negalelo elikhulu ekusasazeni iindaba zobuxoki kunye nobuxoki.
The journalism watchdog group said its findings are worrying, as they show deep divisions among media within countries and between countries at the international level.	Iqela elijonga ubuntatheli lithe iziphumo zalo ziyaxhalabisa, njengoko zibonisa iyantlukwano enzulu phakathi kwamajelo eendaba kumazwe naphakathi kwamazwe akwinqanaba lehlabathi.
In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new, said Clayton	Ngo-2022, ayinakuphikiswa into yokuba ukuchasana kwemithombo yeendaba kunye nesiphithiphithi solwazi siphembelela iyantlukwano ekuhlaleni ngeendlela ezintsha,” utshilo uClayton.
Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA.	Weimers, usekela-mlawuli we-RSF e-United States, uxelele i-VOA.
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.	Uthe ukuxhaphaka kweendaba zamaqela kwihlabathi jikelele kufike ngeendleko zobuntatheli obuyinyani.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism.	Ingxelo yonyaka yeli qela ibala amazwe ali-180 ngokusekelwe kwimekobume yobuntatheli obuzimeleyo.
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.	Kulo nyaka, nangona kunjalo, iRSF ithe isebenzise indlela entsha edibanisa iimeko zelizwe ngalinye kwezopolitiko, ezomthetho, ezoqoqosho, ezentlalo kunye nokhuseleko.
"Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as ""having very bad media freedom."	"Ngoku, isalathiso sichaza irekhodi lamazwe angama-28 ""njengenkululeko embi kakhulu yeendaba."
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.	Elo qela libandakanya i-China, ethumela ugcino-mthetho ngaphaya kwemida yalo ngelixa ikhulisa inkohliso ye-Kremlin malunga nemfazwe etshabalalisayo yaseRussia ngokuchasene neUkraine.
"Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting ""false news"" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a ""war."""	"Ukusukela ekuhlaseleni kwayo i-Ukraine nge-24 kaFebruwari, iRussia ifune ulawulo olupheleleyo malunga neendaba, ipasisa umthetho omtsha othwala iminyaka eli-15 entolongweni ngokuxela ""iindaba zobuxoki"" ngomkhosi, kwaye iyakwalela ukubiza kongquzulwano lwayo ne Ukraine ukuba ""yimfazwe."""
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.	Oko kunyanzelise uninzi lweendaba eziseleyo ezizimeleyo, kubandakanya iphephandaba elidumileyo leNovaya Gazeta, unomathotholo we-Ekho Moskvy kunye ne-Dozhd TV, ukuba bavale okanye bahambe ngaphandle kweRussia ukuze baqhubeke nokusebenza.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.	Ukungabikho kwamazwi azimeleyo, iingcali zithi, urhulumente waseRussia ukwazile ukusasaza usasazo ngepropaganda ethoba ubunzulu bemfazwe kwaye isasaze izizathu zobuxoki malunga nohlaselo lweKremlin.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.	Ingcinezelelo yamajelo eendaba yiRassia ime kwi-155 kumazwe angama-180 afakwe kwi-RSF index, apho enye ikhululekile kwaye i-180 ngeyona ingakhululekanga.
It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia, Clayton said.	Kukhuselekile ukuthetha ngoku ukuba amajelo eendaba akhululekileyo yinto yakudala eRussia, utshilo uClayton.
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.	Kuyo yonke iminyaka engama-22 kaMongameli waseRussia uVladimir Putin elawula, iMoscow ibijolise kwiintatheli kunye nakumaphephandaba azimeleyo, utshilo.
But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia, Clayton said.	Kodwa ukusukela oko kwahlaselwa iUkraine, kubonakala ngathi uPutin uwagqibile amajelo eendaba azimeleyo kwaphela eRussia, utshilo uClayton.
At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine.	Okwangoku, akunakwenzeka ukunika ingxelo echanekileyo ngemfazwe yaseUkraine.
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.	I-China ibeke indawo ye-175 kwingxelo entsha. Kwaye ngoku iphantsi kwempembelelo yeBeijing, iHong Kong iphinde yabhalisa ukwehla okumangalisayo, ikwindawo ye-148 kwi-180 kulandela uhlaselo olude lokubanjwa kunye nokuvala iindawo zeendaba zedemokhrasi.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention.	Ifayile yelizwe le-RSF e-China ithi ngoyena mgcini-mabanjwa omkhulu weendaba emhlabeni, kunye ne-120 eluvalelweni.
"The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed ""sensitive."""	"Ulawulo lusebenzisa ukunyanzeliswa, ukuxhatshazwa, ukugrogrisa kunye nokucupha ukugcina iintatheli ezizimeleyo kunye nezangaphandle ukuba zinike ingxelo kwimiba ethathwa njenge miba ""ebucayi."""
President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime, RSF's country file states.	Umongameli u-Xi Jinping, osegunyeni ukususela ngo-2013, ubuyisele inkcubeko yeendaba efanelekile kwixesha le-Maoist, apho ukufikelela ngokukhululekileyo kulwazi kuye kwaba lulwaphulo-mthetho kunye nokubonelela ngolwazi lulwaphulo-mthetho olukhulu ngakumbi, ngokokutsho kwefayile yelizwe ye-RSF.
Rising authoritarianism.	Ukunyuka kokulawula ngegunya
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.	INorth Korea iselelona lizwe libi kakhulu ngokomgangatho liku-180. Kwenye indawo kummandla waseAsia-Pasifiki, izidubedube zezobupolitika, ungquzulwano nokwanda kolawulo-ngegunya olungqongqo kuye kwayitshayela yonke iminyaka yenkqubela.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile.	Ubhukuqo-mbuso lwaseMyanmar lwango-2021 luphawule iminyaka eli-10 yokubuyela umva kumalungelo eendaba, iintatheli zibanjiwe, iilayisensi zemithombo yeendaba zarhoxiswa, kunye neendaba ezininzi ezibuyela elubhacweni.
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.	Phantsi komkhosi womkhosi, iMyanmar, ekwindawo ye-176, yenye yezona ntolongo zinkulu zehlabathi zeentatheli.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.	E-Afghanistan, abavukeli beTaliban bathembisa ngokuyigcina inkululeko yeendaba xa bathatha ulawulo ngo-Agasti ka-2021.
"Instead, RSF said the ""Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence."""	"Endaweni yoko, i-RSF yathi ""ukuhluthwa kwamandla eTaliban kuye kwanda ngakumbi iimeko zeentatheli kunye nemibutho yeendaba, ekujoliswe kuyo kuzo zonke iindlela zokoyikisa kunye nobundlobongela."""
Afghanistan ranked 154th.	I-Afghanistan ikwindawo ye-154.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.	Kwi-Afrika iphela, imithetho eyenza ubuntatheli be-intanethi ibe lulwaphulo-mthetho iye yachaphazela ilungelo lolwazi, i-RSF yatsho, ngelixa ukusasazeka kwamahemuhemu, ipropaganda, kunye nolwazi olungelulo ibe negalelo ekujongeleni phantsi ukufikelela kulwazi olusemgangathweni.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index.	E-Ethiopia, imfazwe kwingingqi yaseTigray, kunye nokucima konxibebelwano kunye nokufikelela okuthintelweyo, zezona zinto ziphambili ezibeka ilizwe ku-114 kwisalathisi.
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.	Ummelwane i-Eritrea kunye ne-Djibouti zimbi kakhulu, zibekwe kufuphi nezantsi kwi-179 kunye ne-164, ngokulandelanayo.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.	Amajelo eendaba ase-Afrika ayaqhubeka nokusokola kwezoqoqosho, iRSF ithe luhlahlelo olukhaphayo.
Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks, the group saidClayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.	Ngaphandle kwamaza enkululeko ngeminyaka yoo-1990, kusekho amaxesha amaninzi, amatyala ovavanyo olungekho mthethweni, ngakumbi kwi-intanethi, ngokuvalwa kwenethiwekhi ngamanye amaxesha, ukubanjwa kweentatheli kunye nokuhlaselwa ngobundlobongela, utshilo uClayton.
When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect, he said.	“Xa sivumela isiko lokungohlwaywa ukuba libekho apho oozwilakhe bevunyelwa ukuba baye emva kweentatheli, bazixhaphaze, bababambe, bazibethe ezitalatweni bazibulale, loo nto ibaneziphumo,” utshilo.
It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same.	Iqinisekisa kwa lowo unegunya linye ukuba ayenze kwakhona kwixesha elizayo, kwaye iqinisekisa abanye abasemagunyeni ababukeleyo benze okufanayo.
US is not perfect.	I-US ayigqibelelanga.
"After a period of seeing its media attacked as ""fake news"" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index."	"Emva kwexesha lokubona amajelo eendaba ehlaselwa ""njengeendaba zobuxoki"" ngowayesakuba nguMongameli uDonald Trump, iUnited States yagcina inqanaba eliphezulu le-42 kwisalathiso seRSF."
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.	Oku kubulela kakhulu ekubuyeni kwe-White House rhoqo kunye nezishwankathelo ze-arhente yomanyano.
"But RSF said problems persist, including ""the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."""	"Kodwa i-RSF ithe iingxaki ziyaqhubeka, kubandakanya ""ukunyamalala kwamaphephandaba asekhaya, ukuhlukaniswa okucwangcisiweyo kwemithombo yeendaba, kunye nokukhuliseka kobuntatheli ngamaqonga edijithali phakathi kwesimo sentiyo kunye nobundlongondlongo kwiintatheli, phakathi kwezinye."""
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.	Izithintelo zikhona, umzekelo, xa kufikwa ekugqumeni oorhulumente bamazwe kunye noqhanqalazo.
We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them.	Siye sifumanise ukuba oku kungenxa yokungahoywa okucacileyo kwemithetho elawula iirekhodi ezivulekileyo okanye iintlanganiso, okanye bayitolika gwenxa.
"An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event,"" said Beth"	Umntu utolika ngendlela engeyiyo ukuba intatheli inokubakho kumsitho othile, utshilo uBeth Francesco, umlawuli omkhulu weNational Press Club Journalism Institute.
A few bright spots.	Iindawo ezimbalwa eziqaqambileyo.
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.	Ngaphandle komkhwa wokuhla ngokubanzi, uClayton uthe kukho izinto ezintle.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.	Abanye oorhulumente banikela ngemali kumajelo eendaba ngaphandle kokuphazamisana nemisebenzi yabo, ukuze baqinisekise ukuzimela geqe kwimpembelelo yezobupolitika.
"If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media, he said, noting that ""it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."""	"Ukuba ujonga phezulu kuluhlu lwethu, ezinye zezinto ezibalaseleyo ngala mazwe anenkxaso-mali eqinileyo kuluntu kumajelo eendaba, utshilo, ephawula ukuba ""kubalulekile ukwahlula inkxaso-mali karhulumente kumajelo eendaba kunye nokulawulwa ngurhulumente."""
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index.	Amazwe amathathu aseScandinavia - iNorway, iDenmark kunye neSweden - ngokulandelelana eza phezulu kwisalathiso seRSF.
Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.	I-Estonia, eyayisakuba yiriphabliki yeSoviet Union, ikwindawo yesi-4.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.	I-RSF ithe ukusetyenziswa ngokukhululekileyo kobuntatheli kudlala indima enkulu kwiidemokhrasi ezivelayo ezifana ne-East Timor, indawo ye-17, iBhutan, ibekwe kwi-33, kunye ne-Mongolia, i-90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places.	I-East Timor yayililizwe elinomgangatho ophakamileyo, lenyuka ngeendawo ezingama-54.
"But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, ""care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."""	"Kodwa i-RSF ilumkise ukuba ngenxa yokutshintsha kwendlela yokusebenza kulo nyaka, ""kufuneka kuthathwe unonophelo xa kuthelekiswa umgangatho kunye namanqaku ka-2022 ethelekiswa nalawo ka-2021."""
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms.	Ukubulawa, Ukuvalelwa Kuxhonywe phezu koHlaziyo lwezomthetho lwaseSaudi.
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.	ISaudi Arabia ityhala ukuba ihlaziye inkqubo yayo yezobulungisa eqatha kodwa uhlaziyo lugutyungelwe kukubulawa kwabantu kunye nempatho enzima yabachasayo, iphakamisa imibuzo malunga nokuba kungatshintsha kangakanani na.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.	Ubukumkani baziwa ngokutolika ngokungqongqo umthetho we-sharia yamaSilamsi, osisiseko senkqubo yawo yokugweba.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.	Kodwa kwezi nyanga zidlulileyo uye waqhubela phambili nohlaziyo abathi abahlalutyi banokwenza iinkundla zabo zisebenze njengezinye ezikuMbindi Mpuma.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.	Loo nzame ixhomekeke kuthotho lwemithetho emitsha kwimiba ebuthathaka efana namalungelo oqhawulo-mtshato lwabasetyhini kunye negunya lejaji lokumisela izigwebo zolwaphulo-mthetho.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.	Yabhengezwa kulo nyaka uphelileyo ngumlawuli we-de facto Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, amanyathelo, kuquka ikhowudi yokuqala yesohlwayo ebhaliweyo, ibonakala ihambelana nenjongo yeSaudi Arabia yokuvula ihlabathi kunye nokuthambisa umfanekiso walo ogqithiseleyo.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.	Nditsho nabagxeki bayavuma ukuba utshintsho lunokwenza iinkundla zaseSaudi ziqikeleleke ngakumbi, kwezinye iimeko.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.	Kodwa akukho lindelo lokuba izithintelo kwinkululeko yokuthetha ziya kudamba, okanye inkqubo yomthetho iya kubaphatha ngokufanelekileyo abachasi bakarhulumente.
"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."""	"Kwaye ngaphandle kohlaziyo, abasemagunyeni ngaxeshanye babonelele ngezikhumbuzo zento eyanika iSaudi Arabia igama layo elikhohlakeleyo kwasekuqaleni, ngokukodwa ukubulawa kwabantu abaninzi be-81 ngosuku olunye ngo-Matshi ngenxa yezono ezinxulumene ""nobunqolobi."""
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.	Imithetho emibini emitsha sele yamkelwe yiKhabhinethi yaseSaudi. Omnye ulawula ukwamkelwa kobungqina, ngaphambili ngokwengqiqo yabagwebi.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June.	Owesibini, umthetho wosapho, uza kuqala ukusebenza ngoJuni.
In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.	Kwinkqubo eqhelekileyo elawulwa ngamadoda, yandisa amalungelo abasetyhini abaqhawule umtshato kwisondlo kunye nokugcinwa kwabantwana babo.
"Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented ""a major qualitative leap"" for women's rights and ""family stability."""	"Ebhengeza umthetho omtsha ngoMatshi, iNkosana uMohammed yathi imele ""inqanaba eliphezulu lomgangatho"" kumalungelo abasetyhini kunye ""nozinzo lwentsapho."""
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.	Uhlaziyo lubonakala njengenxalenye yokubonelela iifemu zangaphandle ezityalwa imali kubukumkani, utshilo uAdel al-Saeed, usekela mongameli weEuropean Saudi Organization for Human Rights.
The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image, he said.	“Abanikazi bongxowankulu bayakoyika ukutyala imali kweli lizwe, elidume kakubi kwicala lezomthetho, ngoko le mithetho yenzelwe ukutshintsha umfanekiso,” utshilo.
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.	Umgaqo omtsha wezohlwayo, osaza kutyhilwa, unokuzisa utshintsho olukhulu ngakumbi.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.	Ngaphantsi kwe-sharia, uwexuko kuphela, ubusela, ukuvukela, ukuphanga kuxhobile, ukukrexeza, ukusela utywala kunye nokunyundela kuthwala izigwebo ezimiselweyo. Abagwebi bayekwa ukuba bagqibe ngesohlwayo kwamanye amatyala.
"With a penal code in place, ""the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University."	"Ngekhowudi yezohlwayo, ""urhulumente uya kulindela ukuba abagwebi bangathembele kuqeqesho lwabo kwi-sharia kodwa kunoko kwimithetho yomthetho (esekelwe kwi-sharia) evunywe ngurhulumente,"" watsho uNathan Brown, isazi kwiYunivesithi yaseGeorge Washington."
As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region, said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms.	“Ngenxa yoko, iSaudi Arabia iya kujongeka ngakumbi njengenkqubo yomthetho woluntu, njengamazwe amaninzi kulo mmandla,” utshilo uBrown, ofunde ngohlaziyo lwaseSaudi.
"The result should be more ""predictability,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules ""take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."""	"Isiphumo kufuneka sibe ngakumbi ""ukuqikelelwa,"" utshilo u-Abdullah Alaoudh, ingcali yezomthetho esekwe e-US kunye nomgxeki karhulumente, njengoko imithetho emitsha ""isusa kwi-leeway ... ababenayo abagwebi."""
"But tighter regulation by the monarchy also ""creates a larger problem: lack of independence,"" he added."	"Kodwa ukulawulwa okungqongqo kobukhosi nako ""kudala ingxaki enkulu: ukungabikho kokuzimela,"" wongeze watsho."
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.	Ukumkani uyintloko yenkundla yaseSaudi kwaye usebenza njengenkundla yokugqibela yesibheno.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.	Utata ka-Alaoudh, umfundisi odumileyo uSalman al-Awdah, ubanjiwe ukusukela ngo-2017, ebonakala ngathi uyaziphindezela ngeposti ye-Twitter eyayingqubana nomgaqo-nkqubo waseSaudi Arabia ngexesha lokuhlukaniswa kweQatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.	Ungomnye wabaninzi ababanjiweyo kwingxaki ecacileyo yokuchasa kunye nabo banokucela umngeni kumandla kaNkosana uMohammed.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Omnye weyona mizekelo ibalaseleyo ngowayesakuba yinkosana u-Mohammed bin Nayef, umhlobo weCIA ohlonitshwa eNtshona ngeenzame zakhe zokulwa nobundlobongela obugqithileyo, kodwa ngubani owagxothwa nguKumkani uSalman kumgca wokulandelelana.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.	INkosana Nayef ayizange ibonwe esidlangalaleni ukususela kwiingxelo zokubanjwa kwakhe ngo-Matshi 2020. Ukuvalelwa kwakhe akuzange kuqinisekiswe ngokusemthethweni.
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.	Kwabachasi bakarhulumente, amatyala anjalo omeleza imibuzo malunga nokuba nguwuphi na umahluko oza kwenziwa luhlaziyo lobulungisa oluqhubekayo.
In my view, this is all window-dressing, said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.	“Ngokokubona kwam, konke oku kukufihla inyani,” utshilo uMadawi al-Rasheed, isifundiswa sase-UK kunye nesithethi seqela eliphikisayo leNdibano yeSizwe eyasekwa ngabathinjwa.
It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer.	Kunzima kakhulu ukubona ukuba yintoni intsingiselo yolu tshintsho ngaphandle kweprojekthi yokubonisa (uNkosana uMahammad) njengomhlaziyi.
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.	Ukuxhoma kuyo nayiphi na ingxoxo yobulungisa kunye nohlaziyo lwezomthetho eSaudi Arabia kukubulawa kunye nokunqunyulwa komgxeki kunye nombhali wemihlathi uJamal Khashoggi kwi-consulate yase-Istanbul yobukumkani ngo-2018.
"A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself ""approved"" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a ""rogue"" operation."	"Uvavanyo lwe-intelligence yase-US yafumanisa ukuba iNkosana uMohammed ngokwakhe ""wavuma"" umsebenzi wokubamba okanye ukubulala uKhashoggi, nangona izikhulu zaseSaudi ziphika oku kwaye zisithi ""ngumsebenzi okhohlakeleyo""."
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.	Ngo-Epreli, ngaphambi kokuba uMongameli waseTurkey u-Recep Tayyip Erdogan atyelele i-Riyadh ngoLwesine waza wamkela iNkosana uMohammed, iTurkey yadlulisela ityala ngokungabikho kwabarhanelwa abayi-26 kwimeko yaseKhashoggi eSaudi Arabia.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.	Isigqibo saseTurkey sitsale uqhanqalazo olunxungupheleyo lwamagqwetha kunye nentombi kaKhashoggi, eyanyanzelisa ukuba iinkundla zaseSaudi azinakukwazi ukumisa ityala elinesihlahla.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.	Kwabo banabantu ababathandayo abavalelwa kude, ukubulawa kukaKhashoggi kunyusa uloyiko olufanayo malinga nokuthetha ngokukhululekileyo.
I want to, many do, but we're scared, said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.	“Ndiyafuna, abaninzi bayayenza, kodwa siyoyika,” watsho umhlobo weNkosana uSalman bin Abdulaziz, ovalelwe noyise ukusukela ngo-2018.
Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuKhashoggi.
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans	IMoroccan Prison Program imisela ukutshintsha i-IS Veterans
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war.	Njengomlwi weqela le-Islamic State oshiye ilizwe lakhe laseMorocco ukuya kuba yinxalenye yento awayecinga ukuba ngumlo ongcwele eSyria, uMohsin uthi wabona yonke inkohlakalo yemfazwe.
A terrifying experience, he says.	Amava awoyikisayo, utsho njalo.
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims.	Ngoku elibanjwa, elineminyaka engama-38 ubudala libanga ukuba akasenguye laa mntu wayenenzondelelo yempambano ngelo xesha, enomsindo wokubulala abantu abangengawo amaSilamsi.
Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.	Ubanjelwe eTurkey waza wathunyelwa eMorocco, uthothoza iminyaka elishumi entolongweni ngezityholo zobunqolobi.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.	Ngoku lo wayesakuba ngumlwi uphumelele kunye namanye amabanjwa ali-14 agwetywe kulwaphulo-mthetho lwenkqubo yase-Morocco yotshintsho enokuthi ibenze bafaneleke ngakumbi ukukhululwa phambi kwexesha.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat.

And to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.	Kwaye enze udliwano-ndlebe namanye amabanjwa phantsi kweemeko ezibekwe esweni nezilawulwayo. Amagosa olawulo lwentolongo akhetha amadoda amathathu athi akulungele ukuba nodliwano-ndlebe.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.	Amagosa amisela ukuba amabanjwa akufunekanga achazwe ngamagama awo apheleleyo kwaye ubuso bawo bungaboniswa, echaza izizathu zokufihlwa kwabo.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.	Kodwa amagosa entolongo akazange amamele udliwano-ndlebe okanye angenelele ukuvala imigca yemithombo yeendaba yemibuzo okanye iimpendulo zamabanjwa.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates.	Amabanjwa ali-15 anxibe iihempe neebhulukhwe ema ngokundilisekileyo ephulaphule umhobe wesizwe waseMorocco kwaye anikwa iziqinisekiso.
Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business.	Amagosa entolongo athi inkqubo yotshintsho yayibandakanya iinyanga ezintathu zokufundiswa ngonqulo entolongweni, umthetho nezoqoqosho, kwaye amabanjwa nawo afumana uqeqesho ngendlela yokuqalisa ishishini.
These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.	Aba basanda kuphumelela bebeliqela lethoba ukusukela oko yaqala inkqubo ngo-2017.
"Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates ""to change their behavior and improve their life path."""	"UMoulay Idriss Agoulmam, umlawuli weSocial-Cultural Action and Prisoner Reintergration kwintolongo yaseMorocco, uthe le nkqubo yeyabo bafunayo kwaye isebenza namabanjwa ""ukutshintsha indlela yokuziphatha kunye nokuphucula indlela yabo yokuphila."""
It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes, he said.	“Ivumela amabanjwa ukuba aqonde ubunzulu beempazamo zawo,” utshilo.
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence.	Ukuthweswa isidanga kule nkqubo akuwenzi amabanjwa afanelekele ukukhululwa kwangoko, kodwa konyusa amathuba awo okufumana uxolelo lwasebukhosini okanye isigwebo esincitshisiweyo.
That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says.	Kube njalo ngaphezu kwesiqingatha sabafundi abaphumeleleyo abangama-222 ukuza kuthi ga ngoku, utshilo abaphathi bentolongo.
Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act.	Ukusukela ngo-2019, olu qeqesho lunikezelwe kwabasetyhini abagwetywe phantsi koMthetho waseMorocco ochasene nobunqolobi.

Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage	Iyantlukwano, iimbono ezitsha ziyasetyenziswa kuMbindi Mpuma
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism.	U-Natalia Sancha ebesoloko esamkela indlela yokusebenzisana kubuntatheli.
When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.	Xa eyokwenza umsebenzi wakhe ngaphandle, uthetha nabanye abagubungela ibali elifanayo ngeembono zabo.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.	Oku ngokuyinxenye kuvela kumdla wokubalisa amabali angabaliswayo ngokwaneleyo, kodwa njengentatheli yasethyini kwindawo elawulwa ngamadoda, uthi intsebenziswano kunye nokuxhasa amanina asebenza nawo ibisoloko ibalulekile.
I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story, the 42-year-old journalist said.	“Bendikhe ndithethe neentatheli zamadoda nabasetyhini, kwaye bendisoloko ndiqaphela ukuba abasetyhini banembono efanayo, kuba nathi besinamava afanayo ngelixa sibhala eli bali,” yatsho intatheli eneminyaka engama-42 ubudala.
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.	Le ndlela yokusebenzisana yaqala ukusebenza ngo-2020 xa umvakalisi wabuza uSancha ukuba unomdla wokubhala incwadi ngeSyria.
She countered with a better offer.	Wachasa enombono olungcono.
I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect, she said.	“Ndimxelele ukuba ibali elidityanelweyo leentatheli zabasetyhini malunga nommandla obanzi lingaba nefuthe elahlukileyo,” utshilo.
I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense.	Ngendiyibhale ngokwam le ncwadi, kodwa ayinakuba nengqiqo efanayo.
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.	Onemvelaphi yaseAndalusia kumazantsi eSpain, uSancha uchithe iminyaka eli-14 edlulileyo kuMbindi Mpuma egubungela ungquzulwano eIraq, eSyria naseYemen, kwaye enika ingxelo eseEgypt, eLebhanon naseTunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.	Usebenze kutsha nje nesebe lezonxibelelwano le-European Union, emva kokushiya i-Beirut ngenxa yezizathu zempilo kulandela ugqabhuko-dubulo olukhulu olwanyakamisa isixeko ngo-2020.
"Women ""have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to."	Abasetyhini “banamava ahlukileyo kuba besisiya kwiindawo abangaziqhelanga oogxa bethu abangamadoda.
"Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated,"" Sancha told VOA."	"Hay ngenxa yokuba sihlakaniphile, kodwa ngenxa yokuba uninzi lwalo mmandla lusengama-Arabhu, amaSilamsi kunye nolwahlulo ngokwesini, ""uSancha uxelele iVOA."
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.	Ukuba neentatheli zabasetyhini kunempembelelo, waphawula.
If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict.	Ukuba ndizibeka kwindawo yomfundi, ndingathanda ukuba nomntu wasetyhini ondixelela ibali kuba liza kuba malunga ne-100 yepesenti yabemi, oku kuthetha ukuba uya kuba nengxelo ebandakanya ngakumbi kwingxabano. .
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.	Kwincwadi yakhe, u-Sancha wafikelela kwabanye abafazi abagubungela uMbindi Mpuma, ukuqinisekisa iimbono ezahlukeneyo ezivela kwiintatheli zangaphandle kunye nezasekhaya.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.	Isiphumo sentsebenziswano ephantse ibe yiminyaka emibini yiBullets for All, ekhutshwe ngeSpanish ngoAprili.
"In the book, ""we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women"" from the region, Sancha said."	"Kulencwadi, ""sibalisa ibali elinye ngamazwi ahlukeneyo amele bonke abafazi"" bendawo, utshilo uSancha."
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war.	Nganye ibonelela ngembono yobuqu malunga nokugubungela amaxesha embali, kubandakanya ukuwa koorhulumente bolawulo-melo, intshukumo yoqhanqalazo edumileyo kunye nemfazwe.
It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.	Ikwavavanya ucalucalulo kunye nokuxhatshazwa kwabasetyhini abajongana nabo kwigumbi leendaba nakwizabelo.
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily.	UMaya Gebeily uthi ukuqonda ulwimi nenkcubeko kunegalelo elikhulu ekwenzeni inkqubela kulo mmandla.
The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.	Umphathi we-Reuters Bureau yeLebhanon, iSyria kunye neJordani ngomnye wabanegalelo kule ncwadi.
There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting, she said.	“Kuninzi okuthethwa nokuboniswa ngokwembono yeentathezli zasethyini nazo ezithi ziphenjelelwe ngamakhosikazi athe zadibana nawo ngethuba zisenza ingxelo,” utshilo.
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.	Ozalelwe e-US kubazali baseLibanon, uGebeily waqala umsebenzi wakhe wobuntatheli ngo-2013 kwindawo yeendaba yasekhaya eBeirut, eLibanon. Uqhubekile nokugubungela ummandla we-Agence France-Presse ngaphambi kokujoyina iReuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting.	UGebeily uthe imvelaphi yakhe yaseMelika kunye neLibanon yamnceda ukuba awuqonde ngcono ummandla, nto leyo eye yabumba ingxelo yakhe.
Knowing the local language is an important part of that.	Ukwazi ulwimi lwasekuhlaleni yinxalenye ebalulekileyo yoko.
When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust, she said.	“Xa unodliwano-ndlebe nomphathiswa okanye umntu oshiye ikhaya okanye itshantliziyo, eyona nto ibalulekileyo kukufumana ukuthenjwa ngabo,” utshilo.
If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. 	Ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha ulwimi kwaye ubenze bazive bekhululekile kwasekuqaleni, oko kutshintsha yonke into.
It grants you a very beautiful kind of access.	"Ikunika uhlobo oluhle kakhulu lokufikelela. """
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.	Ukongeza e-Iraq naseLebhanon, uGebeily, oneminyaka engama-30 ubudala, naye uye waya eSyria ukuze apapashe imfazwe echasene neqela le-Islamic State (IS).
Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out, she said.	“Ndibe nenyhweba yokufikelela kwiindawo ezithile zoluntu ngokuthe ngqo ngaphandle kokuba ndisebenze nomguquleli okanye umlungisi, nto leyo ebumba indlela aphuma ngayo amabali,” utshilo.
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.	Intatheli yaseSyria-Kurdish uKhabat Abbas, obhale ngemfazwe yaseSyria, uyangqina ukubaluleka koko.
Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you, she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria.	Kukwazi ulwimi kunye nenkcubeko eyenza abantu bazive bekhululekile ukuba bathethe nawe, uxelele iVOA evela eQamishli, eSiriya.
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria ,	Olo lwazi lwanceda xa uAbbas, oneminyaka engama-34 ubudala, ngethuba esebenza ngaphandle noSancha ngoMatshi 2021. Baya kwinkampu yamaKurdish ababevalelwe kumntla-mpuma weSiriya,
And interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais.	Babe nodliwano-ndlebe nama-jihadists abhinqileyo anxulumene ne-IS, ngebali e-El Pais.
While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the came refused to talk to them,	“Ngethuba ndandiseQamishli [kumntla-mpuma weSyria], ndadibana neentatheli ezimbini zaseBritane, oogxa bam abalungileyo, ababedanile emva kukaShamima Begum nabanye namanye amanina enkampini ala ukuthetha nabo,
""" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS."	”utshilo uSancha, ebhekisa kumfazi oselula owashiya ikhaya lakhe eBritane eneminyaka eli-15 ukuya kujoyina i-IS.
Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents, Sancha said.	Umlungisi wabo wayeyindoda, ngoko ke abafazi be-jihadist abazange bathethe nabo ngenxa yokuba abathethi namadoda. Kodwa ke ndakwazi ukuhlala noShamima kunye nabanye abafazi, abanikela udliwano-ndlebe oluhle ngaphakathi kweentente zabo,  Watsho uSancha.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.	U-Abbas wayenefuthe ekufumaneni ukuthetha nabo bafazi, wongeze watsho.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.	Ngokungafaniyo noSancha kunye noGebeily, u-Abbas wakhulela kwingingqi yaseKurdish yaseSyria, apho kwada kwaqala imfazwe ngo-2011, ubuntatheli babungekho.
Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines, Abbas said.	“Abantu abaqhelekileyo kwingingqi yethu bebeqhele ukubona abantu basetyhini bethatha izixhobo kwaye besilwa, kodwa bebengaqhelanga ukubona umntu obhinqileyo ebambe ikhamera ezitratweni  nangaphambili,” utshilo u-Abbas.
It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues.	Kwathatha ukuzincama okukhulu ukuze ndiqinisekise usapho lwam kunye noluntu ukuba ndilungile, ukuba andingcono, njengabalingane bam abangamadoda.
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.	Ubuntatheli bamtsala umdla kuba ibali loMbindi Mpuma belisoloko libaliswa ziintatheli ezingamadoda, alapha ekhaya nakwamanye amazwe.
The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, 	Ibali alitshintshanga ngenxa yoko, kodwa ukuba iintatheli zasekhaya kunye nezamazwe ngamazwe zabasetyhini bafumana ithuba lokwenyani lokubalisa ibali loMbindi Mpuma,
"that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region,"" Abbas said."	ibali lingatshintsha, elinokuthi lichaphazele indlela abanye abawubona ngayo lo mmandla,”utshilo uAbbas.
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.	U-Sancha naye ukholelwa ukuba abafazi kwi-journalism banempembelelo kwindlela imiba ejongwa ngayo kwingingqi, kubandakanywa uxinzelelo emva kokuphazamiseka kunye nomphumo onalo kwimpilo yabasetyhini, kunye nezifundo ezifana nobundlobongela kunye notywala.
We talk about all these issues that men normally would not speak about, she said.	“Sithetha ngayo yonke le miba amadoda ebengafuni kuthetha ngayo,” utshilo.

Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program.	Umkhosi wase-Iran wenze isibhambathiso sokuziphindezela kabukhali kulo naluphi na uhlaselo lwe-Israel, esoloko ivakalisa inkxalabo ngenkqubo yenyukliya yase-Iran.
Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.	UTehran uthi le nkqubo yeyeenjongo zoxolo kuphela.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.	I-Israel, ubukho bayo i-Islamic Republic engabuboniyo, kudala isoyikisa ngenyathelo lomkhosi ngokuchasene ne-Iran ukuba iingxoxo phakathi kweTehran kunye namagunya ehlabathi ziyasilela ukunqanda umsebenzi wenyukliya waseIran.

As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?	Njengoko bambalwa abantu baseMelika abaya eCaweni, ingaba iivenkile zekofu zinako ukuzalisa ililize?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.	Iicawe kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo ngokwembali bezidlala indima ebalulekileyo yezentlalo nezopolitiko kuluntu lwaseMelika.
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.	Kodwa bambalwa abantu abaya kwiinkonzo zonqulo, kwaye ukuwohloka kweecawe kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo kusongela ukushiya indawo enokuthi ivalwe ziivenkile zekofu.
For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation, says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.	Kwimbali enkulu yaseMelika, icawe ibiyeyona nto ibalulekileyo - okanye amabandla abo ebebalulekile, ebonelela ngendima engachazwanga ekuboneleleni ngentsebenziswano kunye nokunxibelelana eluntwini ... Iziko loPhando kuBomi baseMelika kunye nomntu ophezulu kwiZiko loShishino laseMelika.
It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church, Cox says.	“Ayizange ibe sisenzeko nje okanye ithamsanqa ukuba umbutho wamalungelo abantu uphume ecaweni,” utshilo uCox.
And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important.	Kwaye uyayibona loo nto ngokwenkcubeko ... nokuba kukwiindawo ezihlala abantu abamhlophe ubukhulu becala, kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni, naphi na apho, iicawe bezikade zibalulekile ngokwembali.
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.	Iinkonzo kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo nazo ziye zadlala indima ekuncedeni abantu abavela kwamanye amazwe ukuba bafane bakuba befikile eMelika, utshilo uCox.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.	Ngo-1999, i-70% yabantu baseMelika bathi bangamalungu enkonzo, i-mosque okanye indlu yesikhungu.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%.	Ngo-2020, elo nani lehle laya kutsho kuma-47%.
A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.	Uvavanyo luka-2019 lufumanise ukuba bathathu kwabalishumi abantu baseMelika abathi baya kwiinkonzo zeveki ngeveki.
Third places  Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray	Iindawo zesithathu Ukunqongophala kokubandakanyeka kunye nokuzibandakanya neecawe, iimosque kunye nezindlu zesikhungu kuthetha ukuba abantu banokuphoswa yintoni isazi ngentlalo yoluntu uRay.
"Oldenburg dubbed as ""third places"" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the ""first place,"" and work, the ""second place,"" might not."	"U-Oldenburg ezibizwa ngokuba  ""ziindawo zesithathu"" - iindawo zokuhlanganisana zikawonke-wonke ezibonelela ngento ethile ekhaya, ""indawo yokuqala,"" kunye nomsebenzi, ""indawo yesibini,"" azingenako zona."
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.	U-Oldenburg waxoxa ukuba iindawo zesithathu zibalulekile kubomi boluntu ekuhlaleni.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.	Uphando luka-Okthobha ku-2021 olwenziwa yiAmerican Survey Center lufumanise ukuba iindawo zorhwebo njengezindlu zekofu zikhuthaza ukuthembana kunye noqhagamshelo kuluntu lwaseMelika kwaye inokunceda ukuvala isithuba esishiywe ziinkonzo.
If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good, says clinical psychologist Dr.	Ukuba uqhelekile kwindawo yokusela ikofu, umenzi kofu unokuyazi into oqhele ukuyi-odola, kwaye bakwenzele yona, kwaye oko kuvakala kulungile, utsholo ugqirha wolwazi ngengqondo.

UMaria Espinola, unjingalwazi oncedisayo kwiDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience kwiYunivesithi yaseCincinnati College of Medicine.
It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways, Espinola says.	Kuvakala kumnandi ukuqatshelwa, ukwazi ukuba abantu bakulindele, ukwazi ukuba abantu bakukhathalele, ukwazi ukuba unendawo, kuba imfuno yokuba nendawo kunye nokunxibelelana kwabantu sisidingo esisisiseko esinayo sonke, kwaye kubalulekile. ukuba oko kuzalisekiswe ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo,”utshilo uEspinola.
So, places like third places can allow us to do that.	Ke, iindawo ezinjengeendawo zesithathu zinokusivumela ukuba senze loo nto.
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.	Ngaphambili, iinkonzo nezinye izindlu zonqulo beziyindawo yesithathu kubantu abaninzi baseMerika.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place	Ngo-2019, iipesenti ezingama-67 zabantu abaphononongwayo bathi banendawo yesithathu
a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other places in their community that they visit regularly.	ivenkile yekofu, indawo yokusela, indawo yokutya, ipaki okanye ezinye iindawo kwiindawo abahlala kuzo abazindwendwela rhoqo.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.	Elo nani lehle laya kutsho kwi-56% ngo-2021 - inani elinokuchatshazelwa sisifo sikazwelonke i-COVID-19.
What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community, says Cox.	“Into esiyifumeneyo kukuba abantu ababenendawo yesithathu banxibelelene kakhulu noluntu lwabo,” utshilo uCox.

Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems?	Ingaba izithintelo ze-COVID-19 ziyawoyisa amajoni omzimba abantwana?
Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.	Ezinye iingcali zonyango zivakalise inkxalabo yokuba amanyathelo othintelo lwe-COVID-19, njengokugquma imaski kunye nokufundela emakhaya, anokuthi enze buthathaka amajoni omzimba wabantwana ngokubakhusela kwizigulo eziqhelekileyo zobuntwana.
There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.	Zininzi izizathu zokukholelwa ukuba abantwana kufuneka bavezwe kwizinto zokugcina amajoni emizimba yabo enamandla, ukuze ukuba bathe badibana nento eyingozi kakhulu, banamanye amajoni omzimba okunokuthi awele kwaye ancede abakhusele kwezo zinto. Utsho uSara Sawyer, unjingalwazi webhayoloji yemolekyuli, yeselula kunye nophuhliso kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Ekuzalweni, iintsana ezisesichengeni zifumana izilwa-buhlungu ezisuka kunina kubisi lwebele, oluzinceda luzikhusele de zibe nokwakha owazo amajoni omzimba.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.	Akuyongozi ukuba iintsana ziqalise ukubeka izinto emilonyeni yazo ngokukhawuleza nje ukuba zizuze ubugcisa obaneleyo bokuthatha izinto.
They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. 	“Bayenza loo nto ngenxa yokuba bavavanya imekobume kwaye bakha amajoni omzimba.
"That's an evolutionary trait,"" Sawyer says."	Luphawu lokutshintsha kwezinto,” utshilo uSawyer.
Theyre exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity. 	“Baveza imizimba yabo kwiintsholongwane ngendlela ethile, ekumgangatho wokwakha amajoni emizimba yabo.
"So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things."""	"Ngoko ke, abanye abantu banokuthi izigulo zobuntwana, ezinjengokubanda kunye nesisu, zakha amajoni omzimba ukuze xa kuvela izinto eziyingozi ngakumbi, sizilungiselele kwaye singaguli ngenxa yezo zinto ziyingozi."""
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Ngaphambi kwesifo sikazwelonke, ubungqina be-epidemiology bacebisa ukuba abantwana abakumazwe aphuhlileyo, apho ukuhlanjwa kwezandla kunye nokusetyenziswa kwesicoci sezifo kuxhaphake kakhulu, banokuba namajoni omzimba angaphuhlisiyo xa kuthelekiswa nabantwana abakumazwe asakhasayo abasoloko bedibana neebhaktheriya ezininzi, iintsholongwane kunye nezinto ezinokuthi zenzeke.
"This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the ""hygiene hypothesis."""	"Oku kwenza abantwana kumazwe ahambela phambili kwezoqoqosho babe sesichengeni sokuphuhlisa izifo ezizimelayo, ezaziwa ngokuba yi ""hygiene hypothesis."""
The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.	“IHygiene Hyphothesis eneneni iyaxabanisa kuba kucingelwa ukuba ukudibana kwethu neentsholongwane ayisiyiyo yodwa into,” utshilo uCody Warren, ugqirha wentsholongwane kunye nogcino lwamajoni omzimba osebenza  kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.
A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in. 	“Uninzi lwale nto lunokuchazwa lufuzo, ukutya, kunye nendawo esihlala kuyo.
That also shapes our immune system… it's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.	Oku kubumba amajoni ethu omzimba… yinto yokwenyani enezinto ezininzi esingenako ukuziphendulela ngokupheleleyo ngokunxiba iimaski.
"There are other things that go into that equation."""	"Kukho ezinye izinto ezingena kulo mba."""
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.	UWarren, utata wabantwana abathathu abancinci, uthi ukuchitha ixesha elininzi ngaphandle yenye yeendlela zokulinganisa izinto ezingalunganga zokuba wedwa.
Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system, Warren says.	“Ukuphonononga nje iintsholongwane kwindawo esingqongileyo kuluncedo [kwaye] nokuqeqesha amajoni ethu omzimba,” utshilo uWarren.
Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them. 	“Amajoni ethu omzimba aqeqeshwa ngokutya esikutyayo, okunezinto ezincinci esingaziboniyo kuko.
"And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."""	Kwaye ke, ngaphandle kwento yokuba sikhe sabambeka kancinci, diyaqonda ukukuba amajoni ethu omzimba azakubambelela.”
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times.	Kukho ezinye izinto abazali abanokuzenza, utsho, ukomeleza amajoni omzimba kubantwana babo ngamaxesha obhubhane.
One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines. 	“Enye yezona zinto zibalulekileyo onokuthi uzenze kukuhlala usexesheni ngezitofu zokugonya.
"That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems,"" Warren says."	Le yenye yeendlela ezilungileyo ekufuneka siqeqeshele amajoni ethu omzimba,” utshilo uWarren.
But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress. 	Kodwa kwakhona, okubaluleke ngokulinganayo kukuqinisekisa ukuba abantwana bethu banokutya okufanelekileyo kwaye balawula uxinzelelo.
"It's been well documented that both of those — having a good diet, a less stressful environment — can have a positive impact on our immune system."""	"Kubhalwe kakuhle ukuba zombini ezi-zokutya okulungileyo, indawo ephantsi koxinzelelo-zinokuba nefuthe elihle kumajoni ethu omzimba. """
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.	Nje ukuba amagosa ezempilo karhulumente athi iimaski azisafuneki, uSawyer ucinga ukuba ukukhomba izinto ezintle zokubeka iimaski zethu kunokuqinisekisa abazali abathandabuzayo abanexhala lokugula kwabantwana babo.
Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.	“Mhlawumbi kufuneka sibe nencoko esidlangalaleni malunga nezizathu ezinokubakho zokususa lo maski, ukuba basesikolweni, kwaye sibuyele kwindawo eqhelekileyo yezigulo zobuntwana ezikhuselekileyo,” utshilo.
The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids aagainst new things that then come along.	Elona cala libalaseleyo lezigulo zobuntwana kukuba banokwakha indlwane ye-hornet yokungakhuseleki enokukhusela abantwana kwizinto ezintsha ezizayo.

These circumstances are familiar to those who benefit from the Adolescent Girls Initiative.  	“Ezi meko ziqhelekile kwabo baxhamlayo kwiAdolescent Girls Initiative.
Who benefits?A dozen such teenage girls and young women visited the World Bank from developing Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries.	Ngoobani abaxhamlayo?

Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.	UHathaway uxelele abaphulaphuli ukuba, ngoncedo lombutho wophuhliso, uSanchita wafumana imfundo waza waboleka i-60 yeedola ukuze athenge inkomo aze aqalise isitiya semifuno.
The teenage girl could then afford to pay her own school fees, as well as her brother's, and contribute to her family in such a way that Sanchita's parents hope she does not marry any time soon.	Intombazana ekwishumi elivisayo yayinokukwazi ukuzihlawulela imali yesikolo, kunye neyomninawa wayo, ize ibe negalelo kwintsapho yakowayo ngendlela yokuba abazali bakaSanchita babe nethemba lokuba akayi kutshata kungekudala.
Hathaway spoke of her own childhood in a comfortable suburban U.S. neighborhood, and of a time when she had no idea about the kind of circumstances Sanchita faced nor how much girls need safe spaces for education.	UHathaway wathetha ngobuntwana bakhe kwindawo ekhululekileyo yase-US, kunye nexesha apho wayengazi malunga nohlobo lweemeko uSanchita ajongene nazo nokuba angakanani na amantombazana adinga iindawo ezikhuselekileyo zokufunda.
Places that could teach them how to take the light they have as girls and ignite the world, explained Hathaway.	“Iindawo ezinokubafundisa indlela yokuthatha ukukhanya abanako njengamantombazana kwaye bakhanyise ihlabathi,” ucacise watsho uHathaway.
I wouldn't know how much the world needs 'The Girl Effect.'	Andiyi kukwazi ukuba ihlabathi lifuna kangakanani 'i-Girl Effect.'

World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.	Umongameli weBhanki yeHlabathi uRobert Zoellick uthe ukungatyali mali kumantombazana kuyaphazamisa uphuhliso.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.	Wongeze ngelithi, ukufundisa amantombazana kuyavakala nakwiintsapho ezihluphekayo, esithi unyaka owongezelelweyo wemfundo yamabanga aphakamileyo unganyusa umvuzo wabo nge-10 ukuya ku-20 ekhulwini.
If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates, Zoellick said.	“Ukuba bafumana umvuzo omkhulu banokufikelela ngakumbi kulwazi kunye neenkonzo zempilo yokuzala, ngoko ke banokulibazisa umtshato kunye nokuzala, babe neentsana ezisempilweni kwaye bafikelele kumazinga aphezulu okufunda,” utshilo uZoellick.
The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty.	Ubungqina bubonisa ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba utyalo-mali kumantombazana afikisayo yindlela ephambili yokuqhawula iipatheni zentlupheko phakathi kwezizukulwana.

Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes	Amatshantliziyo anyanzelisa uncedo olungcono lokuphelisa udlwengulo lwaseCongo
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.	Njengoko ummeli okhethekileyo we-UN kubundlobongela obuphathelele kwezesondo kungquzulwano uMargot Wallstrom eqalisa uhambo olutsha oluya eDemocratic Republic of Congo, amatshantliziyo amabini mva nje aqukumbele iinzame zokuphembelela e-United States ngenyathelo elisebenzayo lokuzama ukuphelisa udlwengulo olunxulumene nongquzulwano eCongo.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that	Omnye wabo, uJustine Masika Bihamba, uxelele indibano yaseWashington, D.C., abafundi baseyunivesithi nabemi abaxhalabileyo ukuba

She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.	Uthe kwezi meko amanina athathwa njengamaxhoba, kwaye awabandakanyeki ekufuneni uxolo.
Striving for peace in the region.	Ukuzabalazela uxolo kulo mmandla.
Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.	UBihamba uququzelela umbutho obizwa ngokuba yiSynergy of Women Against Violence.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work.	Abacebisi kunye neqela baye bahlaselwa kwaye basongelwa ngenxa yomsebenzi wabo.
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.	Xa uBihamba wayesemsebenzini ngenye imini, amajoni aseCongo ahlasela ikhaya lakhe, aza axhaphaza ngokwesini enye yeentombi zakhe.
Bihamba explained that what is needed - above all - is peace in eastern Congo.	U-Bihamba wachaza ukuba into efunekayo - ngaphezu kwayo yonke into - luxolo empuma yeCongo.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.	Uthe ukholelwa ukuba izenzo zolwaphulo-mthetho ngokwesondo ziyakwehla kakhulu ukuba umlo uyaphela.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.	Itshantliziyo uDonatella Rostagno, ovela kunxibelelwano lwaseYurophu kuMbindi Afrika, wahamba noBihamba kuhambo lwakhe oluya eUnited States.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.	Uthe uyawuxhasa umsebenzi owenziwa ngummeli okhethekileyo we-UN kubundlobongela obuphathelele kwezesondo kungquzulwano.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.	U-Rostagno uphinde wathi, nangona kunjalo, uluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe alwenzi ngokwaneleyo ukumisa imfazwe yaseCongo, nangona inomsebenzi omkhulu wokugcina uxolo we-UN apho.
The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict, said Rostagno.	“Ubuninzi bezenzo zenziwa kujongwe iziphumo, kusetyenzwe nabasetyhini abangamaxhoba, kodwa akwanelanga kujongwa oonobangela bodlwengulo nongquzulwano,” utshilo uRostagno.
Deteriorating situation amid global concern.	Imeko iya isiba maxongo phakathi kwenkxalabo yehlabathi.
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.	Woyika ukuba imeko xa iyonke kwimpuma yeCongo iya isiba mbi kakhulu, hayi ngcono - ngaphandle kokuhoywa ngamazwe ngamazwe - ngabavukeli, amajoni, kunye namajoni avukelayo asaqhuba.
A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us, said Rostagno.	“Uninzi lwala maqela abavukeli aphinde alungelelaniswe, kwaye ade angenele umanyano ngoko ke iintshukumo esizibonayo kulo mmandla, ziyasikhathaza,” utshilo uRostagno.
I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today. 	“Ndicinga ukuba besinethemba kulo mmandla kwiinyanga ezintandathu ezidlulileyo kunanamhlanje.
The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province. 	“Umbutho weZizwe eziManyeneyo uchonge amaqela amathathu axhobileyo adlwengule inkitha yabantu

Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.	Abo babandakanyekayo nguMai Mai Cheka, iDemocratic Liberation Forces yaseRwanda, kunye nabalandeli bomgqakhwe womkhosi, uColonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.	Izindululo zokuphuculwangexesha lokunikela kwabo intetho, amatsha ntliziyo amabini, uBihamba noRostagno, nabo banike izindululo ezibambekayo zokwenza imeko ibengcono.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.	URostagno ucacisile ukuba imibutho yangaphandle engekho phantsi kukarhulumente ifumana inkxaso-mali yokuqubisana nomba wobundlobongela obuphathelele kwezesondo, kodwa imibutho yasekuhlaleni ihlala ingahoywa.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.	Uthe izicelo ezintsonkothileyo zokufumana inkxaso-mali yangaphandle zithanda imibutho emikhulu.
They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money. 	Bangayenza nje, bayayithumela, bayayifumana imali.
"The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access,"" said Rostagno."

Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015.	Iingcali zezoQoqosho zibona amagingxingxi kwindlela eya phambili kuQoqosho lwaseMalawi ngo-2015.
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate.	Iingcali zoqoqosho eMalawi zithi eli lizwe kusenokwenzeka ukuba liqhubeleke lijongene nemingeni yemali ngo-2015 ngaphandle kokuba urhulumente angaphinda athembeke kubaxhasi, abasabambe umyinge wamashumi amane eepesenti ekhulwini wenkxaso yohlahlo lwabiwo-mali ngenxa yorhwaphilizo olwaziwa njengeCashgate.
More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.	Imali engaphezu kwezigidi ezingama-30 zeerandi yaphangwa kwingxowa-mali karhulumente kulo manyala, yaye abantu abaliqela, kuquka namagosa karhulumente, babanjwa.

of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.	waseMalawi, bathi ukuhla kwenkcitho konakalisa uqoqosho.
This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. 	“Lo ibingunyaka wamagingxigingxi njengoko siphuma kwiziphumo zeCashgate ezithe kratya kuqoqosho lweli.
We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals.	Sibonile ukuba kwiimeko ezininzi amasebe abuthathaka nabalulekileyo kunye nabanikezeli beenkonzo baye bachaphazeleka, ngendlela yokuba asinawo amayeza aneleyo ezibhedlele.
"In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time,"" said Mwanyungwe."	Ezikolweni, intlawulo yootitshala ayifiki ngexesha,” utshilo uMwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	UMwanyungwe ukwayamanise iCashgate nokuhla kwexabiso lemali yaseMalawi, kwacha, okubangele uqhankqalazo lwabasebenzi abohlukeneyo bakarhulumente befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Umzekelo, abasebenzi abanika inkxaso kwiinkundla bezikwisithuba seeveki ezintandathu begwayimba, befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo ngeepesenti ezingamashumi amane anesihlanu ekhulwini nto leyo urhulumente athi akanako ukuyifikelela kuba akanamali.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.	Abasebenzi beAnti-Corruption Bureau eMalawi baye bagwayimba befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo ngamashumi asixhenxe ekhulwini de urhulumente wabagrogrisa ngelithi baza kuphulukana nemivuzo yabo kaDisemba ukuba ababuyi.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.	UMwanyungwe uthe urhulumente angalunqanda olunye uqhankqalazo ngo-2015 ukuba wenza iinzame zokubuyisela intembeko yabaxhasi kulawulo lwemali karhulumente.
My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, 	“Uloyiko lwam kukuba, ukuba asinalo ukuzithemba kwabaxhasi kunye nenkxaso yabaxhasi ibuyela kuqoqosho,
We may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation, said Mwanyungwe.	Singanyazela urhulumente ukuba angene kwimboleko-mali yasekhaya enokuthi ikhokelele kwiziphumo ezibi malunga nokunyuka kwamaxabiso, ngokwenzala yemali-mboleko kwaye oku kunokuba nemeko yokuphulukana nokubanjiswa,” utshilo uMwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.	Abaxhasi, phakathi kwezinye izinto, bafuna urhulumente atshutshise bonke abo babandakanyekayo kulo mbhodamo kwaye omeleze inkqubo yolawulo lwemali.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered	UNewton Kambala, umongameli weMalawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, uthe ihlazo elenziwe.
"2014 as ""a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."""	"U-2014 ""njengonyaka ombi kakhulu kwicandelo loshishino, ngenxa yamatyala amakhulu urhulumente awatyala icandelo labucala."""

In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.	Kwintetho yakhe yobume besizwe ngoMgqibelo odlulileyo, umongameli waseMalawi uPeter Mutharika uthe urhulumente wakhe wenza konke okusemandleni ukulungisa iingxaki ezibangelwe lihlazo leCashgate.
My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. 	“Urhulumente wam uqinise inkqubo yezemali ukuqinisekisa ukuba iCashgate ayiphindi yenzeke eMalawi.
"We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible,"" said Mutharika."	Siwasebenzise kakuhle amaziko ogcino-mthetho aquka iAnti-Corruption Bureau ukuze enze umsebenzi ozimeleyo ngokucokisekileyo, atshutshise bonke abarhanelwa, abuyise nezixhobo ezibiweyo apho kunokwenzeka,” utshilo uMutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.	UMutharika ukwathe urhulumente wakhe uphumeza inguqu entsha yezemali efuna ukukhulisa uqoqosho lwelizwe nge-5.5 pesenti ngo-2014, isuka kumyinge we-5.0 yeepesenti ngo-2013.
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing	IMalawi izakwenza uVavanyo lwe-HIV kwindlu ngendlu
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year.	Abantu baseMalawi banezimvo ezahlukileyo kwizicwangciso zikarhulumente zokuqalisa ngovavanyo lwe-HIV kwindlu ngendlu ekuqaleni konyaka ozayo.
Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily.	Abaxhasi bathi eli nyathelo lifuneka ngokungxamisekileyo kuba abantu baseMalawi abali-100 bayasulelwa suku ngalunye, yaye umlinganiselo we-138 ubulawa nguGawulayo mihla le.
Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.	UMphathiswa wezeMpilo uJean Kalirani ubhengeze ezi zicwangciso ngethuba kutsha nje isikhumbuzo soSuku lweHlabathi lwe-AIDS kwisithili esisemantla eKaronga.
We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. 	“Sizakungena ezilalini sicela ukuba sithathelwe igazi ukuze kujongwe ukuba loo mntu akanayo na okanye akanayo na.
And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need.	Kwaye abo baya kufunyanwa bene-HIV ngokuqinisekileyo baya kunikwa ukhathalelo abaludingayo.
"And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative,"" said Kalirani."	Nabo bafunyenwe bengenayo nabo bazolulekwa ukuze bahlale bengenayo,” utshilo uKalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are	UKalirani uthe eli phulo lizakuqala phakathi kuMatshi kwaye liza kujolisa ukufikelela kumntu wonke kweli lizwe kuquka nabantu abakhoyo
far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services.	kude nezibonelelo zempilo ezibonelela ngeenkonzo zokuvavanyelwa i-HIV kunye neengcebiso.
She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030.	Uthe eli phulo lihambelana nenjongo yokuphelisa usulelo lwe-HIV ngo-2030.
Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.	Umlinganiselo wosulelo lweHIV eMalawi ngoku ukwi-10 ekhulwini, ukwehla kancinci xa kuthelekiswa neminyaka emithathu eyadlulayo.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.	Esi sibhengezo sinyuse uloyiko kwabanye abantu baseMalawi, abanjengoSteven Jailosi, utitshala wesikolo samabanga aphantsi eBlantyre, ocinga ukuba eli phulo lingaphazamisa ubumfihlo babantu.
I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. 	“Ndicinga ukuba akulunganga kuba baza kuphazamisa ubumfihlo bethu.
HIV testing is supposed to be private.	Uvavanyo lwe-HIV kufuneka lube lolwabucala.
"No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them,"" said Jailosi."	Akukho mntu ekumele ukuba azi ukuba ndiye kuvavanyo lwe-HIV ngaphandle kokuba ndenza ukhetho lokumxelela,” utshilo uJailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.	U-Ester Makonokaya, unobhala eBlantyre, uthe nangona sele evavanyiwe, uvakalelwa kukuba ukuvavanyelwa intsholongwane kaGawulayo kwindlu ngendlu kuzokophula iimfihlo zabantu.
Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions, said Makonokaya.	“Urhulumente makathathe ezi kliniki zihambayo azise ezilalini apho abantu bazokwazi ukufikelela kuzo bodwa kunokuba baye kuvavanyo emakhayeni abo, kuba loo nto ingathetha ukuba abanye abantu ekungafanelanga ukuba bazazi iimeko zabanye abantu. kuba uyazi ukuba xa umntu evavanyiwe ubonakalisa ukusabela,” utshilo uMakonokaya.
"Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own ""without being pushed."""	UMacpherson Maulana, intatheli yaseBlantyre nokwangumvelisi weenkqubo zikanomathotholo ngezempilo, uxelele iVOA ukuba urhulumente uzokwenza ngcono ukufundisa abantu baseMalawi ngesidingo sokuvavanyelwa intsholongwane kagawulayo ukuze abantu baziyele ngokwabo uvavanyo ngaphandle kokutyhalwa.
I fear it could end up into fights. 	“Ndiyoyika ukuba ingaphelela ekulweni.
You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed.	Uyabona kwenzekile eLiberia mva nje apho abantu ababeze kunceda abantu ekurhaneleka ukuba bosulelwe yi-Ebola bade babulawa.
"So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily,"" said Maulana."	Ngoko ke, imfundo yezoluntu yeyona nto ibalulekileyo ukuze abantu bakhuthazwe ukuba baphume baye kuvavanywa ngokuzithandela,” utshilo uMaulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.	Nangona kunjalo, umcebisi weHIV/AIDS, uDavid Odali, nophethe umbutho i-Umunthu Foundation eqhuba iiprojekthi ezinxulumene ne-HIV, ugxininise ukuba iimfihlo ziza kukhuselwa.
Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. 	Imfihlo iya kugcinwa. Makhe siqwalasele ukusekwa kwekhaya.
I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family.	Ndicinga ukuba into yokuqala iya kuba kukubonelela ngengcebiso yeqela kumalungu olo sapho.
"[Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately,"" said Odali."	[Ewe] abantu banokuvavanywa ngelixa abanye bejonge, kodwa xa kuthethwa ngeziphumo, umcebisi kufuneka aveze ezo ziphumo kumntu ngamnye ngokwahlukeneyo,” utshilo u-Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.	UOdali uthe izakuba kuye umntu ovavanyiweyo ukuba aveze ubume bakhe.

Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi	Ingxaki Yamanzi Iphakamisa Uloyiko Lwezifo Ezibangelwa Ngamanzi eMalawi
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water.	Abantu baseMalawi abakwikomkhulu lezorhwebo lelizwe, iBlantyre, bakholisa ukuxhomekeka kumanzi aphuma empompo.
But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.	Kodwa kwezi nyanga zintlanu zidlulileyo, iitepu bezisoloko zomile, nto leyo enyanzelise abahlali ukuba bakha amanzi kwimithombo engakhuselekanga efana nemilambo namaqula, logama kusetyenzwa kwisikhululo sokumpompa amanzi edolophini.

Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists	Umongameli waseMalawi uphantsi komlilo ngokunika imali kwiintatheli
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre.	Umongameli waseMalawi uPeter Mutharika utyholwa ngokunika imvulophu equlethe i-125 yeedola kubantu beendaba abangaphezu kwe-80 kwisidlo ebesibambe kwinyanga ephelileyo eBlantyre.
The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.	Umhleli weTimes Television yabucala uthe abacholacholi baxelelwa ukuba iimvulophu zinezicwangciso zoomongameli kumajelo eendaba - nto leyo ibigxeka ukusebenza kukarhulumente kwezoqoqosho.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.	Kwikholamu yakhe epapashwe kwiphephandaba laseMalawi iSunday Times, umhleli uGrecian Tukula uthe akaqinisekanga ngesizathu sokuba le mali inikwe iintatheli kwisidlo sikarhulumente.
"Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid ""creating a scene."""	UTukula uthi uqale wathatha isigqibo sokuyibuyisela le mali kodwa wasirhoxisa eso sigqibo ukuze aphephe “ukuzijongisa.”
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.	Kodwa umhleli wephephandaba iWeekend Nation, uGeorge Kasakula, uxelele iVOA ukuba uyibuyise kwangoko le mali.
I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. 	“Ndavakalelwa kukuba ayifanelekanga ukuba ndiyifumane loo mali, ngoko ndayibuyisela.
My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me.	Ukuqonda kwam kukuba xa umntu endimema kwiworkshop, yindima yabo ukuqinisekisa ukuba uyandondla, uyandihlalisa kwaye uyandithutha.
"But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace],"" said Kasakula."	Kodwa kule meko, andizange ndibone ukuba kutheni ndifanele ndifumane eso sibonelelo kuba andizange ndachitha nto ukuya eSanjika,” utshilo uKasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.	Lo mba utsale umdla woluntu emva kokuba inkampani yabucala yeCapital Radio yasasaza ibali elibuza ngentsingiselo yemali evela kumongameli.
As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public. 	“SiyiCapital FM sisebenzela uluntu.
"This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter,"" said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio."	Lo mcimbi ubugcwele kumakhasi onxibelelwano, kwaye nathi njengamajelo eendaba siyachaphazeleka “sikholelwa ukuba kubaluleke kakhulu ukuba siwulandele kwaye sifikelele ezantsi kulo mba,” utshilo uSteven Dakalira, intloko yeendaba nemicimbi yangoku. kwiCapital Radio.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.	Kwikholamu yakhe kwiNyasa Times, unjingalwazi wezomthetho eMalawi uDanwood Mzikenge Chirwa uthe into eyenziwa nguMongameli Mutharika ngokunika iintatheli imali kumsitho weendaba kufana nokunyoba. Ucele uMutharika ukuba arhoxe okanye ajongane nenkqubo yokubeka ityala.
"Local civil society groups said that ""by attempting to bribe the journalists"" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute."	Amaqela oluntu asekuhlaleni athi “ngokuzama ukunyoba iintatheli” uMutharika wadelela isidima sakhe sobunkokeli.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.	Ngeli xesha, ezinye iintatheli zinikela ngemali kumbutho wesisa.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.	UBrian Ligomeka, uMhleli oLawulayo weTimes Group, uxelele iTimes Television ukuba bobane abasebenzi abalapho banikele ngemali kwikhaya leenkedama.
At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children, said Ligomeka.	“Siqale sathatha isigqibo sokuba siyibuyisele kumongameli le mali kodwa sabona bubulumko ukuba sithenge izinto ezahlukahlukeneyo ezifana neswekile, ityuwa, iincwadi zokubhalela sanikezela kubantwana abasweleyo,” utshilo uLigomeka.
"In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists ""for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."""	Kwikholamu yakhe yamva nje yeSunday Times, uRaphael Tenthani, okwabhalela iBBC, ucele uxolo egameni lezinye iintatheli “ngokuphoxa uluntu ukuba luthembe iintatheli ngokungagodli.
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.	UTenthani ukhuphe le mali yemisebenzi yesisa esithi nangona iintatheli bezinokwenza ngcono ukuba bezinokubuyisela le mali ngoko nangoko, ukwenza njalo bekuya kubonwa njengokungahloniphi intloko yelizwe.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of	UMaclan Kanyangwa, okhokela iSebe lezobuntatheli kunye nezifundo zosasazo kwiKholeji yasePolytechnic kwiYunivesithi yase
Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.	IMalawi, ithe ikhowudi yezokuziphatha yeendaba ithintela iintatheli ukuba zamkele intlawulo ngebali.
Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. 	“Ngokucacileyo indibano eyayisebhotwe yayisisiganeko esibalulekileyo seendaba.
There was a possibility that something was going to be published.	Kwakunokwenzeka ukuba kukho into eyayiza kupapashwa.
"And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem,"" said Kanyangwa."	Kwaye kwimeko apho le ntlawulo inokuba nefuthe kwisigqibo sentatheli [kwisigwebo seendaba], loo nto iba yingxaki,” utshilo uKanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.	UKanyangwa uthe uvakalelwa kukuba iintatheli ezininzi zisilele ukubuyisela le mali ngoko nangoko kuba kusenokwenzeka ukuba zazingekho ezingqondweni xa zazifumana le mali.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful.	Iinzame zokuthetha neGosa likaMongameli weendaba uFredrick Ndala azikhange zibe yimpumelelo.
But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.	Kodwa abanye abaphathi bakarhulumente bathi le ntlawulo ibingesosinyobo kodwa yenzelwe ukubuyisela amafutha kwabo bebezimase umsitho wasebusuku.
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty.	Ingxelo: Ukwenziwa kwezinto kunokukhulula izizwe ezihluphekileyo kubuhlwempu.
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.	Ingxelo entsha yeZizwe eziManyeneyo ikhuthaza amazwe ahlwempuzekileyo emhlabeni ukuba atshintshe ukusuka kwizinto eziphantsi ukuya kwimveliso ephezulu ukuphucula uqoqosho lwawo.
"In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the ""poverty trap,"" which is stunting economic growth and development."	KwiNgxelo yayo yaminyaka le yaMazwe angaPhuhliswanga kangako, i-UNCTAD — iNkomfa yeZizwe eziManyeneyo yoRhwebo noPhuhliso – ithi la mazwe kufuneka aguqule ngokwesakhiwo uqoqosho lwawo ukuze akhululeke “kumgibe wentlupheko,” nto leyo edodobalisa ukukhula koqoqosho nophuhliso.
"Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers ""Least Developed Countries"" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015."	"Kwiintlanga eziyi-48 i-U.N. iqwalasela ""ILeast Developed Country’s"" (LDCs), enye kuphela, iLaos, isendleleni yokufezekisa zosixhenxe iiMillennium Development Goals (MDG's) ngo-2015."
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.	Ngamazwe amane kuphela ase-Afrika - i-Ethiopia, iMalawi, iRwanda kunye ne-Uganda - anokuthi afikelele uninzi lwezi njongo.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years.	Olu vavanyo lubi kakhulu ngenxa yemiceli mngeni emikhulu elindele la mazwe kwiminyaka ezayo.
The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015.	I-MDGs ibeke injongo yokuba izizwe zinciphise amanqanaba entlupheko ngesiqingatha ngo-2015.
The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.	Izinto ezibizwa ngokuba yiSustainable Development Goals, eziqhubela phambili ukusuka apho i-MDGs ziyeke khona, ibiza ukupheliswa kwentlupheko ngo-2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.	Ngokutsho kukaTaffere Tesfachew, igosa le-UNCTAD elisebenza nezizwe zase-Afrika, akuyi kuba yinto engummangaliso ukuba ii-LDC zikhuphe oku.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.	Ukuze awona mazwe angaphuhlanga aphumeze lo mmangaliso, uthi kuyakufuneka ukuba atshintshe ngokwesakhiwo uqoqosho lwawo.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.	Uxelela iVOA oku kuthetha ukutshintshwa kwabasebenzi kwimisebenzi enemveliso ephantsi, efana nezolimo ezincinci kunye neenkonzo ukuya kwimisebenzi eguqukayo enemveliso ephezulu, efana nemveliso kunye neenkonzo zexabiso eliphezulu.
Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, 	“Amazwe anyukileyo ngawo adala amathuba okuba abo bashiya ezolimo bazibandakanye kwizinto apho bongeza ixabiso, apho bafumana uqeqesho nanjengoko kusenzeka, imveliso ithanda ukuba nolo hlobo,
that is why this call for manufacturing, he said.	yiyo loo nto ikhwelo lokwenziwa kwemveliso,” utshilo.
Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better.	Amazwe asebenzisa imigaqo-nkqubo yokutshintsha kunye nokuphembelela inkunzi kunye nabasebenzi ukuba bangene kweli candelo lomsebenzi bavame ukwenza ngcono.
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods.	UTesfachew uthi la macandelo anemveliso ephezulu athambekele ekuhlawuleni imivuzo ephezulu kwaye enze imfuno yempahla.
This, he says, encourages investment.	Oku, uthi, kukhuthaza utyalo-mali.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly.	Ngasentla, kubonakala ngathi ii-LDCs azenzi kakubi.
UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community.	Idatha yezoqoqosho ye-UNCTAD ibonisa ukukhula kula mazwe ahlwempuzekileyo phakathi kuka-2002 kunye no-2008 kugqithise kwiipesenti ezisixhenxe ekujoliswe kuzo ezibekwe luluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe.
And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.	Kwaye, nasemva kwentlekele yezemali ka-2008, i-UNCTAD iqaphela ukuba ii-LDCs zikhule ngokukhawuleza kunamanye amazwe asaphuhlayo, kumyinge we-5.7 yeepesenti ngonyaka.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain.	Kodwa izazi ngezoqoqosho ze-UN zithi imbonakalo yamazwe angawona aphuhlileyo kwixesha elifutshane neliphakathi ayikaqinisekwa.
They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.	Bathi ukwandisa imveliso yabantu yeyona ndlela ilungileyo yokuphelisa ukusilela kophuhliso lwabantu kunye noqoqosho oluqhubeka lubarhintyela kubuhlwempu.
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals.	I-UN: Uninzi lwezizwe zase-Afrika ziphosakele kwi-MDG Goals ka-2015.
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development.	Uninzi lwamazwe aseAfrika aluyi kufikelela kwiMillennium Development Goals ezimiselwe u-2015 ngenxa yomsantsa phakathi kophuhliso loqoqosho noluntu.
That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.	Eso sesinye sezigqibo salonyaka kwingxelo yonyaka ye-U.N.  kuMazwe angaPhuhlanga kangako, enikezelwe ngoLwesine.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.	UJunior Davis, igosa le-UN lemicimbi yezoqoqosho e-Afrika, uthe amazwe ase-Afrika khange akwazi ukuguqulela ukukhula koqoqosho kwinguqu yezakhiwo.
We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities, Davis said.	“Sicinga ukuba kunjalo kuba la mazwe khange agxile ngokukuko ekwakhiweni kwento esiyibiza ngokuba ngamakhono awo okuvelisa,” utshilo uDavis.
These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. 	“La ngamakhono asisiseko ophuhliso lwabantu noqoqosho afunekayo ukukhuthaza uphuhliso loqoqosho oluzinzileyo.
"And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."""	Kwaye i-MDG, njengoko yakhiwa, ayizange ihoye ubukhulu becala isidingo sokuphuhlisa amandla oveliso.”
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow.	Amazwe ase-Afrika nawo akakho endleleni yokunciphisa intlupheko ngesiqingatha ngo-2015, kwaye inkqubela yawo iyonke ekunciphiseni indlala ihamba kancinci.
Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity.	Ubuhlwempu budodobalisa uphuhliso lomntu kwaye bujongela phantsi imveliso.
And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.	Kwaye uphuhliso lwezoqoqosho luyafuneka ukwenza inzuzo kuphuhliso lwabantu.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals.	Yi-Ethiopia, iRwanda, iUganda neMalawi kuphela kwamazwe aseAfrika asendleleni yokufikelela uninzi lweenjongo zophuhliso.

Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services	Uqhankqalazo luqhwalelisa iiNkonzo zeNkundla zaseMalawi
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials.	Uqhankqalazo oluthathe iveki yonke lwabasebenzi bokuxhasa inkqubo yenkundla yaseMalawi liqhwalelise iinkundla, nto leyo ebangele ukuxinana kwizisele zamapolisa kunye nokunqunyanyiswa kwamatyala amakhulu - kuqukwa namatyala urhwaphilizo kurhulumente.
Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.	Iimashali zenkundla, oonobhala kunye nabathunywa bafuna ukonyuselwa imivuzo ngamashumi amathathu eepesenti ekhulwini ababethenjiswe ngurhulumente kwiminyaka emibini edlulileyo.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.	Ukuxhentsa nokucula kwindawo yenkundla ibe ngumsebenzi wokuzonwabisa kubasebenzi benkundla ababegwayimbile ukusukela oko kuqale ukuhlaliswa kwabantu kwiveki ephelileyo.
Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.	ULinley Hebert, isithethi sabasebenzi abagwayimbileyo, uxelele iVOA ukuba olu qhankqalazo lubangelwa kukungaphumeleli koorhulumente ukuhlonipha isivumelwano sika2012.
In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.	“Ngenyanga kaOkuthowbha [kulo nyaka] urhulumente uye waphonononga imivuzo yabasebenzi bakarhulumente, kodwa asizange sibandakanywe kolo hlaziyo,” utshilo uHebert.
Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well]. 	“Kodwa ngo-2012, saba nesivumelwano sokuba qho xa behlaziya imivuzo yabasebenzi bakarhulumente, [babe besonyusa imivuzo yethu].
"So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out."""	"Ke, [emva kokubambelela kwisivumelwano ngo-2013], siyamangaliswa kukubona ukuba ngeli xesha sishiywe ngaphandle. """
Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.	Abasemagunyeni kurhulumente bathi ukusilela ukonyusa imivuzo yabasebenzi benkundla kulo nyaka kungenxa yokunqongophala kwemali, kulandela ukumiswa koncedo lwabaxhasi ngokuchasene norhulumente waseMalawi.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.	Oku kuqhwanyaza kweliso kubangelwe sisityholo semali sikarhulumente apho kwaphangwa ngaphezu kwezigidi ezingama-30 zeerandi kungxowa-mali karhulumente.
Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.	Isithethi sesebe lezimali u-UN Msowoya uxelele isikhululo sikanomathotholo sasekuhlaleni ukuba kunzima kurhulumente ukuhlangabezana nemfuno yabasebenzi.
"It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands, ""Msowoya said."	“Kunzima ukuthembisa into eza kwenziwa ngunondyebo. Kodwa kwanele ukuthi imeko yezoqoqosho egqubayo kunye nokunqongophala kohlahlo lwabiwo-mali kuza kwenza kubenzima kancinci ukuba unondyebo athobele amabango,” utshilo uMsowoya.
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.	Kodwa ngokukaHebert, abahlaseli abazuphinda baqhubeke nomsebenzi de kuhlangatyezwane neemfuno zabo.
Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money. 	Oko ndazalwa [akuzange kubekho xesha] urhulumente wathi unemali.
"It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money,"" Hebert insisted."	Ineendlela zayo [zokufumana imali] kwaye iya kufumana iindlela ezifanayo zokusinika imali,” utshilo uHebert.
The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.	Uqhankqalazo oluqhubekayo luyiqhwalelisa inkqubo yamatyala, njengoko imisebenzi yeenkundla isanqunyanyisiwe.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.	Amatyala aliqela, kuquka elo lalowo wayesakuba ngumphathiswa wezobulungisa uRalph Kasambara, nophendula izityholo malunga notyhobo lwemali, anqunyanyisiwe kwiveki ephelileyo.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.	Amapolisa akhala ngokuxinana kwizisele zentolongo, nanjengoko kungekho barhanelwa abasiwa enkundleni.
"Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is ""giving police bail to those with minor offenses."""	"Isithethi samapolisa aseMalawi uRhoda Manjolo uxelele iVOA ekuphela kwendlela abanayo ""kukunika ibheyile yamapolisa kwabo banamatyala amancinci."""
Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.	Abakhankaseli bamalungelo oluntu kunye neengcali zomthetho zithi olu qhankqalazo lunegalelo ekunyhashweni kwamalungelo oluntu.
There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours, noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu.	“Kukho abo bantu kufuneka basiwe enkundleni kwiiyure ezingamashumi amane anesibhozo,” liqaphele igqwetha uGeorge Kadzipatike osebenza kwindawo yabucala kumantla esixeko saseMzuzu.
We cannot make application for them to be granted bail. 	“Asinakusenza isicelo sokuba banikwe ibheyile.
"There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."""	Kukho abo bantu bangafuniyo ukuhlala namaqabane abo, bangathanda ukuba inkundla ikhuphe isigunyaziso sokuba baqhawule umtshato, asinakufaka isicelo kwiinkundla zamatyala.”
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.	Abasemagunyeni kurhulumente bathi uthethathethwano oluvaliweyo lokusombulula lo mba luyaqhubeka kwikomkhulu, iLilongwe.
But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.	Kodwa abasebenzi abagwayimbileyo baxelele iVOA nokuba yintoni na, abazukwamkela nto ngaphandle kokunyuselwa imivuzo yabo ngamashumi amathathu eepesenti ekhulwini.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.	Uqhankqalazo olulolu hlobo lwathatha iinyanga ezintathu ngo-2012 emva kokuba oomantyi neejaji bezibandakanye nentshukumo yabasebenzi.
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted.	IUnited Nations World Food Programme ithi indlala esemazantsi eAfrika imbi kakhulu kunokuba bekucingelwa.
WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.	Amagosa eWFP alumkisa ngelithi abantu abazizigidi ezili-13 kumazwe amathandathu: iMalawi, iZambia, iLesotho, iZimbabwe, iSwaziland neMozambique basengozini yokulamba ukuba abalufumani uncedo lokutya.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it.	Amagosa eWorld Food Programme athi adinga isigidi seetoni zokutya ukuze athobe indlala kumazantsi eAfrika, kodwa abaqinisekanga ukuba baza kukufumana.
In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food.	Kwisibheno kuluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe ekuqaleni kukaJulayi, amagosa eWFP acele ngaphezu kwe-0.5 yeebhiliyoni zeedola ukuthenga ukutya.
So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate.	Ukuza kuthi ga ngoku bafumene kuphela ama-20 ekhulwini oko. Umlawuli weWFP kummandla osemazantsi eAfrika, uJudith Lewis, uthi imeko iya isiba maxongo.
The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing, she said.	“Ithuba lokunqanda into enokuba yingxaki enkulu yoluntu liyavala,” utshilo.
We need more assistance now. 	“Sidinga uncedo ngakumbi ngoku.
"We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."""	"Sifuna ukutya kulwandle oluphezulu ngoku, okanye sifuna imali yokuthenga izinto zorhwebo ezisafumaneka kumazantsi e-Afrika, ukuze sithintele le ngxaki inkulu. """
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries.	Ngoku, iWFP inceda izigidi ezithandathu zabona bantu basemngciphekweni kumazwe amathandathu achaphazeleke kakhulu.
About half of these people are in Zimbabwe.	Malunga nesiqingatha saba bantu baseZimbabwe.
The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.	Le arhente ithi iqinisekile ukuba lizakunyuka inani labantu abadinga uncedo lwayo.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates.	IWorld Health Organization iphawula ukuba ummandla osemazantsi weAfrika, ukongezelela kukwanda kweHIV/AIDS ehlabathini lonke, ukwanelona zinga liphakamileyo lokungondleki liphakamileyo ehlabathini.
It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.	Iqikelela malunga nama-300,000 abantu abanokufa kwiinyanga ezintandathu ezizayo ngenxa yezifo ezinxulumene nokungondleki.
"Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. ""We are seeing people moving from their villages,"" she said."	UNksz Lewis uthi ukufa sele kuqalile. “Sibona abantu befuduka ezilalini zabo,” utshilo.
If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. 	Ukuba bayazi ukuba kuza kwabelwa ukutya, baye ngoko nangoko.
The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas.	Ingxaki kukuba asinako nokutya okwaneleyo kokondla abantu abakwi-rolls, singasathethi ke ngokongeza ukutya kwabanye abantu kwiindawo.
"Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. """	"Ngaba kukho isiphithiphithi esinokubakho? Ewe. """
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October.	UJudith Lewis weWFP uthi ngeli xesha lonyaka le arhente idla ngokucwangcisa indlela yokufumana ukutya kulo mmandla phambi kokuba kufike ixesha lemvula kweyeDwarha.
But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.	Kodwa uthi kuba iWFP sele inobunzima ekufezekiseni iithagethi zayo zangoku, ayinakho nokuqalisa ukucwangcisa ukuhanjiswa kokutya kwixesha elizayo.

Child Labor in Malawi - 2002-02-28	Ukuqeshwa kwabantwana eMalawi - 2002-02-28
The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.	Umbutho, i-Eye of the Child, uvakalisa inkxalabo ngento ekuthiwa luninzi lwabantwana abanyanzelwa ukuba baphangele ngenxa yendlala.
It says these children risk being abused.	Ithi aba bantwana basemngciphekweni wokuxhatshazwa.
Some under aged children work as mini – bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre.	Abanye abantwana abangaphantsi kweminyaka yobudala basebenza njengabakhwazi kwiibhasi ezincinci kwindawo yoshishino exakekileyo eLimbe kwikomkhulu lezorhwebo, iBlantyre.
They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.	Bangabanye babantwana abaninzi abaye banyanzeleka ukuba baphangele ngenxa yokusokola.
Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child. He says many of the children come from rural areas.	UMaxwell Matewere ngumlawuli olawulayo kwi-Eye of the Child. Uthi uninzi lwabantwana luphuma ezilalini.
"He says, ""Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization."	"Uthi, ""Okwangoku asikenzi uhlalutyo lwedatha kodwa uMphathiswa wezaBasebenzi uzimisele ukwenza oko ngokukhawuleza ngemithombo yemali evela kwiInternational Labor Organization."
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.	Kodwa ngokusekwe kuvavanyo lwethu nangemisebenzi yethu, sivakalelwa kukuba ukuqeshwa kwabantwana kuyingxaki enkulu ngakumbi kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni kwaye unokuxela ukuba ukusuka ekurhwebeni kwabantwana besuka ezilalini besiya ezidolophini apho uninzi lolutsha lusebenza kwizindlu zabantu. .
Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates. 	UMnu. Matewere uthi abantwana abangathathi ntweni bahlala befumana umsebenzi kumafama amakhulu.
"He said, ""We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates."	Uthe, “Siqaphele ukuba kukho izinto ezibonisa ukuba kukho abantwana abasebenza kwiindawo zeti necuba.
"There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. """	"Kukwakho abantwana abasebenza ekwenzeni izitena ubukhulu becala abazali babo baya kubaququzelela ukuba basebenze kwezo ntlobo zengqesho. """
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country.	Umnu. Matewere uthi iEye of the Child ifumanise ukuba kukho ukunyhashwa kwamalungelo abantwana kweli lizwe.
These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.	Oku kubandakanya, udlwengulo, ukungcola kunye nokusebenza ngokugqithisileyo.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.	Uthi oku kunyhasha iNkomfa yeZizwe eziManyeneyo ngamaLungelo oMntwana.
"If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child, he said, ""you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education."	"Ukuba ujonga kwiNgqungquthela yamaLungelo oMntwana, watsho, ""uya kubona ukuba ibonelela ngokhuseleko lwabantwana kulo naluphi na uhlobo lokuxhaphaza kulo naluphi na uhlobo lwemisebenzi eyingozi okanye isenzo esisongela impilo yabo, ukukhula kwabo. nto leyo esisisongelo kwimfundo."
"So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. """	"Ngoko ke abantwana abafunyanwa besebenza kwiindawo zeti, abafunyanwa ekwenzeni izitena, kucacile, amalungelo abo njengoko ebonelelwe kwiNgqungquthela yamaLungelo abaNtwana ngokunjalo nakumgaqo-siseko bayagxojwa. """
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.	Umphathi we-Eye of the Child uthi umbutho wakhe ujonga iindlela zokukhusela amalungelo omntwana.
He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs.	Uthi ukuphumeza oku, eli qela liqale iinkqubo eziliqela.
We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child. 	“Kutshanje siqale inkqubo entsha kwaye into esizama ukuyenza kukwazisa uluntu ngokubanzi ngezinto ezilungele umntwana nokubazisa nangamalungelo omntwana.
"At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. """	"Kwangaxeshanye sifuna ukwakha amandla kubantwana ngokwabo ukuze bakwazi ukusebenzisa ilizwi labo lokwenyani ukuvakalisa iinkxalabo zabo. """
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.	Ngokutsho koMphathiswa wezaBasebenzi, abantwana abaninzi banyanzeleka ukuba bashiye isikolo baye kufuna umsebenzi ngenxa yokuba abazali bengakwazi ukuhlawula imali yesikolo.
Although primary school is free in Malawi, most children do not attend due to lack of necessities like clothes.	Nangona isikolo samabanga aphantsi sisimahla eMalawi, uninzi lwabantwana aluyi ngenxa yokunqongophala kwezinto eziyimfuneko njengempahla.
Over 60 per cent of Malawis nearly 11 million people live below the poverty line.	Ngaphezu kwama-60 eepesenti abantu baseMalawi abaphantse babe zizigidi ezili-11 abantu abaphila ngaphantsi komlinganiselo wentlupheko.

The judge said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt the 12 people conspired to kill Masambuka to extract his bones based on a perception they would benefit financially.	Ijaji ithi urhulumente ungqinisise ngaphandle kwamathandabuzo ukuba abantu abalishumi elinesibini benze iyelenqe lokubulala uMasambuka ngenjongo yokukhupha amathambo akhe ngokwembono yokuba baza kuxhamla ngokwasezimalini.
She said Masambuka is the latest victim of violent attacks on persons with albinism who have not been protected by the community.	Uthe uMasambuka lixhoba lamva nje lokuhlaselwa kwabantu abane-albinism abangakhuselwanga luluntu.
Director of Public Prosecutions Steve Kayuni represented the state in the case. He said he was pleased the court agreed on all the seven charges he presented.	Umphathi wezoTshutshiso uSteve Kayuni ebemele umbuso kweli tyala. Uthi uyavuya inkundla ivumelene ngawo onke amatyala asixhenxe awathi wawabeka.
Its really something overwhelming on the part of the state considering that this matter, if you notice, there is a police officer involved, a priest involved and there is a brother involved. 	“Kuyinto exakileyo kwicala likarhulumente xa ucinga ukuba lo mba, ukuba uyaqaphela, kukho ipolisa elibandakanyekayo, umfundisi obandakanyekayo kwaye kukho umzalwana obandakanyekayo.
"If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust — that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him,"" Kayuni said."	Ukuba uyaqaphela, yonke le nto ijikela kwisikhundla sokuthembana — into yokuba umntu ofana nongasekhoyo uMacdonald Masambuka ebemthembile kakhulu, ngabo abagqibele bemngcatsha,” utshilo uKayuni.
Masambuka went missing from his village on March 9, 2018, and his limbless body was found buried in a garden on April 2, 2018, in his home district of Machinga south of Malawi.	UMasambuka waduka kwilali yakhe ngomhla we-9 kweyoKwindla 2018, waza umzimba wakhe ongenamalungu wafunyanwa ungcwatywe egadini ngomhla wesibini kuTshazimpuzi ka-2018, kwisithili sakowabo eMachinga emazantsi eMalawi.
Enticement  Court documents show that Masambuka was enticed by his brother to meet his friends, who he claimed had found a girl for him to marry.	Amaxwebhu enkundla yamatyala abonisa ukuba uMasambuka wahendwa ngumntakwabo ukuba adibane nabahlobo bakhe, abathi bamfumanele intombi afuna ukuyitshata.
But when they reached the scene, the alleged friends grabbed Masambuka by the neck and dragged him to a garden where they killed him. Here, his assailants cut off his limbs, burned his body using petrol and buried it there.	Kodwa bathe bakufika kwindawo yexhwayelo, abo batyholwa ngokuba ngabahlobo bam bambamba uMasambuka entanyeni bamrhuqela egadini apho bambulala khona. Apha, abahlaseli bakhe bamnqumla amalungu omzimba, batshisa umzimba wakhe ngepetroli baza bawungcwaba apho.
This was the first such case involving high-profile community members involved in attacks on persons with albinism.	Eli yayilityala lokuqala elilolu hlobo libandakanya abantu abakwizinga eliphezulu ababandakanyeka kuhlaselo lwabantu abane-albinism.
Masauko Chamkakala, the lawyer for the 12 defendants in the case, said he would comment once he had gone through the judgment.	UMasauko Chamkakala, igqwetha labamangalelwa abalishumi elinesibini kweli tyala, uthe uzakuhlomla xa sele egqibile ukuwisa isigwebo.
We are still waiting to see the perfected judgment so that we can read it and study it and talk to our clients, Chamkakala said.	“Sisalindele ukubona isigwebo esigqibeleleyo ukuze sifunde sifunde kwaye sithethe nabathengi bethu,” uthethe watsho uChamkakala.
Rights activists said they expected the court to give stiffer punishment to those convicted.	Abalwela amalungelo bathi balindele ukuba inkundla inike isohlwayo esiqatha kwabo babanjiweyo.
Serious sentencing'	Isigwebo esiqatha'
Ian Simbota represented the Association of Persons with Albinism at the court.	UIan Simbota ebemele umbutho wabantu abaneAlbinism kule nkundla.
When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts. 	“Xa ijaji yayifunda, eyona nto yayindixhalabisa yile nxalenye [kaMbingeleli] uTata uMuhosha [nabanye] abagwetyelwe ukutshintshisa amalungu omzimba.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.	Ukuba uya kwi-Anatomy Act, ayinzima kangako kwezo ziphoso.
"So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case,"" Simbota said."	Ngoko ke, sijonge ngenene ukuba ijaji, ukuba kunokwenzeka, ibeke ubuso bomntu kweli tyala ukuze noko sidinga ukubona isigwebo esiqatha kweli tyala,” utshilo uSimbota.
The high court is expected to sentence the perpetrators on May 30.	Inkundla ephakamileyo kulindeleke ukuba igwebe abenzi bobubi ngomhla wamashumi amathathu kuCanzibe.
In another case, a high court on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old man to life in prison for the 2020 murder of a 14-year-old-boy with albinism in Phalombe district.	Kwelinye ityala, inkundla ephakamileyo ngoLwesine igwebe ixhego elineminyaka engamashumi amathathu anesixhenxe (37) ubudala ngetyala lokubulala inkwenkwana eneminyaka elishumi elinesine (albinism) kwisithili sasePhalombe ngo2020.
Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy	Igosa laseZimbabwe likhusela uqhanqalazo, libongoza umonde kuQoqosho
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.

Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance.	Ecaphula ukhuseleko loluntu, uye wavumelana nesigqibo senkundla yaseZimbabwe kwiiyure ezingaphambili zokuxhasa ukuvalwa umlomo kwamapolisa kuqhanqalazo olwaluququzelelwa ngumbutho ophikisayo weMovement for Democratic Change (MDC).

They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start.	Bebeququzelele uqhanqalazo ngoMvulo koBulawayo, isixeko sesibini ngobukhulu kweli lizwe, kodwa amapolisa aluvala kwiiyure ezimbalwa phambi kokuba luqale.
Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.	Eminye imiqhankqalazo emibini yenkcaso isacwangcisiwe kule veki: kumbindi wesixeko saseGweru ngoLwesibini nakwisixeko esikumazantsi mpuma eMasvingo ngolwesithathu.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court.	Amapolisa nawo aye aluvala kwangaphambili uqhanqalazo eHarare ngoLwesihlanu odlulileyo, isigqibo esixhaswe yinkundla yaseZimbabwe.
Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police.	Amakhulu-khulu abalandeli be-MDC akasihoyanga esi sithintelo, nto leyo ekhokelele kungquzulwano phakathi kwabahlali namapolisa.
Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.

A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.	Umfana wakwaBulawayo ozichaze njengoJames kuphela, uxelele iVOA ukuba uthethathethwano phakathi kukarhulumente neenkokheli zamaqela aphikisayo zibaluleke ukodlula uqhanqalazo.
Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around. 	“Enyanisweni, ukubonisa, singaphela sonzakele ngokubethwa, sileqwa.
"There's really nothing that we see coming out of it,"" James said."	Akukho nto siyibona iphuma kuyo,” utshilo uJames.
But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. … 	“Kodwa la madoda kufuneka ahlale phantsi abone ukuba angasenzela ntoni, ingakumbi thina silulutsha. …

Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown	Abasebenzi bemibutho yoluntu baqhubela phambili amagosa okhuseleko eTanzania ngomqondiso wokwandiswa kweClampdown
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.	Abakhankasi boluntui base-Afrika bezimase inkomfa e-Tanzania babuzwa imibuzo kwaye balunyukiswa kwimpelaveki, kwinto abathi abalwela amalungelo oluntu yinxalenye yokuqhubekeka koxinzelelo kwintetho ekhululekileyo kwisizwe saseMpuma Afrika.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.	Iinkcukacha zisaphuma malunga nokuba kwenzeke ntoni kanye kanye kubasebenzi boluntu abangama-40 abathe bangquzulana namagosa okhuseleko kwingqungquthela yalo nyaka yoMbutho woPhuhliso lwaMazantsi e-Afrika eDar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.	Kodwa iingcali zamalungelo zathi ngoMvulo esi siqendu sesinye isibonakaliso esixhalabisayo sokunyuka kwezenzo ezingenangqiqo kunye nokuxhatshazwa ngurhulumente.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding.	UCatherine Eden, igqwetha leTanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, uthi esi siganeko sibangelwe kukungaqondi kakuhle.
South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16.	Abathunywa boMzantsi Afrika kwinkomfa yamazwe ali-15, uthe, babefuna ukubamba isikhumbuzo esifutshane sesikhumbuzo sesixhenxe sokubulawa kwendyikitya yokufa yaseMarikana eMzantsi Afrika ngomhla we-16 ka-Agasti.
Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994.	Abasebenzi-mgodini abangamashumi amathathu anesine babulawa ngamapolisa kwesona siganeko sabulala abantu abaninzi ukususela ekupheleni kocalucalulo ngo-1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people.	Ngoko abathunywa kumsitho osecaleni bacula umhobe woMzantsi Afrika, bathi cwaka umzuzwana baze bamemelela kurhulumente wabo ukuba akukhusela ngcono abantu bakhe.
But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans.	Kodwa into ababeyibhale ephepheni yaqinisekisa amapolisa ezokhuseleko ukuba abathunywa banezicwangciso ezinkulu kunoko.
They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 	Babhala imiyalezo ethile kwiitshathi, apho umxholo omncinci owawufakwe kule tshati wawufundeka ngoluhlobo,
"Stop killing our people,'"" she said. ""..."	Yekani ukubulala abantu bethu,'” utshilo.
So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate.	Ke ndicinga ukuba kwakukho umntu wokhuseleko lwesizwe kuloo ntlanganiso kwaye wayibona loo miyalezo kwaye ke wayitolika njengesicwangciso sokubonisa.
"But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania."""	"Kodwa ukuba uyajongisisa, awuboni nabuphi na ubudlelwane bokuba kutheni befuna ukubonisa udubulo lwaseMarikana eTanzania. """
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.	Akukacaci ukuba ukhona umntu owabanjwayo. Amanye amaqela amalungelo athi abanye abakhankasi bamazwe angaphandle babanjwa, kodwa abakhange baabuzwe mibuzo.
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning.	U-Eden uthi ubizwe ngabasemagunyeni njengoko wayesiya kwisikhululo samapolisa ngolwesiHlanu ukuya kudibana nomnxibelelanisi wendawo emva koko wakhululwa ngesilumkiso.
Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat.	Kamva amapolisa aya kumagumbi eehotele zabathunywa ekhangela izinto awayecinga ukuba ziyingozi yokhuseleko.
They found nothing, she said.	Abafumananga nto, watsho.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.	UJanet Zhou, umlawuli weZimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, ngomnye wabakhankasi ababuzwa imibuzo ngabezokhuseleko kwihotele yakhe.
I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least, she told VOA, after returning home to Harare.	“Ndandisoyika, ndandiziva ndingakhuselekanga, ndihlukumezekile ukuba ndingatsho,” uxelele iVOA, emva kokubuyela ekhaya eHarare.
Because seven security details coming over after midnight and questioning me about a demonstration and placards that I wasn't going to be able to give them, was something else.	Ngenxa yokuba amadoda asixhenxe okhuseleko eza emva kobusuku kwaye andibuza imibuzo malunga nomboniso kunye neeplakhadsi endandingazokukwazi ukubanika, yayiyenye into.
"I didn't understand it. It left me really terrified."""	"Andizange ndiyiqonde. Yandishiye ndosoyika ngokwenene. """
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday.	Uthe amapolisa amxelela kunye negqiza lakhe labantu abangama-40- ukuba bahlale ehotele imini yonke yangoMgqibelo.
She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.	Wababuza ukuba babanjiwe na, abazange bamphendule.
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal.	U-Oryem Nyeko, umphandi oseKampala kwi-Human Rights Watch, uqaphele ukuba amapolisa aseTanzania akazange enze into engekhosemthethweni.
But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.	Kodwa, wathi, oko akukwenzi ukuba kulunge, kananjalo.
I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do, he said.	“Ndicinga ukuba yinto efanelekileyo ukuba amapolisa ayenze,” utshilo.
However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves. 	“Nangona kunjalo, umceli mngeni apho kukuba ibonisa ngengxaki ebanzi eTanzania xa kujongwe umba wokuvala indawo yasekuhlaleni kunye namathuba okuba abantu basekuhlaleni baveze izimvo zabo ngokukhululekileyo.
"This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."""	"Le yinxalenye yendlela ebanzi yocinezelo loluntu kweli lizwe. """
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression.	Amaqela amazwe ngamazwe afana neCommittee to Protect Journalists nawo alumkise ngokwanda kwengcinezelo.
"Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a ""deeply troubling erosion of press freedom,"" and of ""attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."""

The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism.	I-CPJ ithethe ngokukodwa ngeentatheli zaseTanzania u-Azory Gwanda, owalahleka ukusukela ngo-2017, kunye no-Erick Kabendera, owabanjwa kwinyanga ephelileyo wabekwa ityala lolwaphulo-mthetho lwezoqoqosho, apho mbutho uthi uziphindezela ngobuntatheli bakhe obugxekayo.
Kabendera remains behind bars. On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate. That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30.	UKabendera  usavalelwe. NgoMvulo, u-Eden, igqwetha lakhe, uthe inkundla igqibe kwelokuba inqumamise ukunika abatshutshisi ixesha elongezelelweyo lokuphanda.

Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian.	U-Anna Henga, umlawuli weLegal and Human Right Center, uthe izenzo zamapolisa ziqhubela phambili inkxalabo eTanzania phantsi koMongameli uJohn Magafuli, apho abangxeki bathu uya ephatha ngegunya.

Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo	Bambalwa abaqhankqalazi abazimase uqhankqalazo lwaseZimbabwe eBulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.	Bambalwa abantu abathe bazimasa  uqhankqalazo eBulawayo, isixeko sesibini saseZimbabwe, ngoMvulo njengoko amapolisa axhobileyo ethe gqolo ukuhlala ezitalatweni nakwinkundla yamatyala apho amaqela aphikisayo anyanzelise ukuba avunyelwe ukuba enze umboniso.
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot.	Amashishini edolophini yakwaBulawayo ahlala ephithizela yothotywa kukuzala kweelori zamapolisa, iimoto zamanzi kunye nentaphane yamapolisa ejikeleza ngeenyawo.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.	Umbutho ophikisayo, iMovement for Democratic Change, yabiza uqhankqalazo njengenxalenye yoqhankqalazo olucwangcisiweyo lokunyanzela uMongameli Emmerson Mnangagwa ukuba avume urhulumente wenguqu phakathi koqoqosho oluwohlokayo kunye noxinzelelo lwezopolitiko.
But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns.	Kodwa amapolisa aluvala uqhanqalazo kwidolophu esemazantsi, echaza inkxalabo yokhuseleko.
A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban.	Umantyi waseBulawayo umamele umngeni wombutho ophikisayo malunga nokuvalwa koluqhankqalazo.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court.	Olu qhankqalazo belucwangciswe njengokulandelela uqhankqalazo obelubanjwe kwikomkhulu, iHarare, ngoLwesihlanu xa abaqhankqalazi abangamakhulu bebengahambisani nomthetho wamapolisa owaphunyezwa yiNkundla ePhakamileyo.
Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest.	Amapolisa asebenzise izintywizisi kunye nokubetha ngeentonga ukunqanda uqhankqalazo lwaseHarare.
Zimbabweans Claim Police Brutality During Economic Protests	Abemi baseZimbabwe babanga inkohlakalo yamapolisa ngexesha yoqhanqalazo lwezoqoqosho
Zimbabweans defied a police ban Friday and held demonstrations to protest the country's deteriorating economy.	Abantu baseZimbabwe baye badelela ukuvalwa koqhanqalazo ngamapolisa ngoLwesihlanu kwaye babambe uqhanqalazo bekhalazela ukudodobala koqoqosho lweli lizwe.
Despite the High Court ban on planned protests, members of the Movement for Democratic Change took to the streets and clashed with police.	Nangona iNkundla ePhakamileyo iye yaluvala uqhanqalazo olucetywayo, amalungu eMovement for Democratic Change angena ezitalatweni angquzulana namapolisa.
Some of the injured accused police of derailing protests, which they said were meant to persuade President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to breathe life into Zimbabwe's moribund economy.	Abanye abonzakeleyo batyhola amapolisa ngokudodobalisa uqhanqalazo, abathi lwenzelwe ukucenga urhulumente kaMongameli Emmerson Mnangagwa ukuba aphefumlele ubomi kuqoqosho lwaseZimbabwe.
With tears on her cheeks, 32-year-old Tafadzwa Bvuta said her degree had not helped her get anything for her three children.	Ethe gwantyi iinyembezi, uTafadzwa Bvuta oneminyaka engama-32 uthe isidanga sakhe asimncedanga nokuba akwazi ukwenzela abantwana bakhe abathathu izinto.
"They beat us up, she said of the police. ""What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all — not just one person."	"“Basibethe basibetha,” watsho ngamapolisa. ""Senze ntoni? Yonke le mikhosi yezokhuseleko kufanele ukuba isikhusele sonke - hayi umntu omnye."
Where will we go and survive?	Siza kuya phi size sisinde?
"Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?"""	"Ingaba kufuneka sibabulale abantwana bethu ekubeni sisokola ukubagcina?"""

Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care.	Abemi baseZimbabwe batsala nzima ngenxa yokonyuka kakhulu kwamaxabiso ngokuhamba kwexesha , ebangele ukuba amaxabiso anyuke kwizinto ezibalulekileyo ezifana namafutha, ukutya, izithuthi kunye nokhathalelo lwezempilo.
Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.	Okongeza iingxaki yimpembelelo eqhubekayo yenkanyamba i-Idai ehlasele iZimbabwe ngoMatshi kunye nembalela enkulu.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.	Umbutho weZizwe eziManyeneyo uthi isinye kwisithathu sabemi baseZimbabwe abantu abazizigidi ezilishumi elinesithandathu badinga uncedo loluntu.

Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs	Ngaphandle  koovimba be-oyile negesi, i-Afrika ifumana uxinzelelo lokunyuka kweendleko zamandla ombane
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.	Abantu baseAfrika baziva becinezelekile ngenxa yokunyuka kwamaxabiso ombane ehlabathini, batsho abahlalutyi, nakumazwe afana neNigeria neAngola angawona athumela ioli ekrwada kwamanye amazwe.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.	Ngelixa elo qela labavelisi be-oyile libona ukunyuka kwengeniso - ingakumbi ukususela ekuhlaseleni kweRussia i-Ukraine ngoFebruwari 24 - ininzi yelizwekazi ayinakho ukucokisa, okunyanzela amazwe ukuba ahlawule amaxabiso aphezulu ukungenisa i-petroli kunye nezinye iimveliso zepetroliyamu ezivela e-Asia naseYurophu.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.	Ilizwekazi lichaphazeleka ngakumbi ngokunyuka kweendleko zegesi yendalo, inxalenye ephambili yezichumisi ezisekelwe kwinitrogen ezisetyenziselwa ukuveliswa kokutya.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.	Njengoko imivuzo ubukhulu becala imile, ngaphezu kwesibini esithathwini sabantu baseAfrika baziva becinezelekile ngenxa yokunyuka kwamaxabiso, utshilo uFranklin Cudjoe, umongameli owaseka i-Imani Centre for Policy and Education yaseGhana.
The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products, Cudjoe told VOA.	“Ilizwekazi liyachaphazeleka nje kuba sixhomekeke kakhulu kubathengisi be-oyile behlabathi, kuba amazwe amaninzi ase-Afrika engenazo iimveliso ze-oyile,” utshilo uCudjoe.
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against	Amaxabiso onyuke kwimarike yeoli yehlabathi emva kohlaselo lwase-Ukraine olubangele ukohlwaywa kwamazwe ngamazwe
Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude.	IRussia, yenye yamazwe ahamba phambili ekuthengiseni izinto ezikrwada kumazwe angaphandle.
The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.	Ixabiso linyuke ngokufutshane laya kuthi ga kwi-120 yeedola umphanda kule nyanga ngaphambi kokuba lihle liye kutsho kwi-103 yeedola umphanda ngoLwesihlanu.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa.	Ukunyuka kwamaxabiso ombane kungunbangela wokunyuka kwezinga lwamaxabiso kwi-Afrika iphela.
In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.	E-Ghana, umzekelo, ukunyuka kwamaxabiso omthengi kuwonke kwakuxhomekeke kwi-15.7% ngonyaka-nonyaka ngoFebruwari xa kuthelekiswa ne-13.9% ngoJanuwari, i-Statistical Service yelizwe yatsho kwiveki ephelileyo.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight.	EZimbabwe, amaxabiso enyuka kakhulu – nangobusuku.
At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday.	Kwivenkile enkulu yeTM kwikomkhulu laseHarare, ikhreyithi yamaqanda angama-30 ixabisa i-6.70 yeedola ngoLwesibini kwaye malunga ne-7.81 yeedola ngoLwesithathu.
The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.	Ixabiso lesonka lasuka kwi-1,49 yeedola ukuya kwi-1,84 yeedola; ngekhilogram yenkomo, ixabiso lenyuke ukusuka kwi-3.35 ukuya kwi-5,22 yeedola.
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.	Amaxabiso epetroli anyukile, nawo. E-Harare, ixabiso le-litha linyuke ukusuka kwi-$ 1.41 ukuya kwi-$ 1.69 ukusuka ngoLwesibini ukuya ngoLwesithathu.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.	Ukunyuka kwamaxabiso okutya kwaba ngoyena mqhubi mkhulu wokunyuka kwamaxabiso e-Egypt, anyuke nge-8.8% ngoFebruwari – okona kunyuka kuphezulu phantse kwiminyaka emithathu, ngokutsho kwe-arhente karhulumente yezibalo, iCAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.	UCudjoe uthe kubalulekile ukuba oorhulumente kunye namaqumrhu engingqi anje ngeManyano yase-Afrika bakhe ukhuselo lokukhusela abathengi ngamaxesha okungaqiniseki kwezoqoqosho.
"Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food, said Cudjoe, adding, ""I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."""	"Nokuba oko kuthetha ukwakha ukhuseleko malunga nokubonelela ngokutya, utshilo uCudjoe, esongeza, ""Ndiyayicingela iNigeria, ukuba yayinendlela yayo, inokuthengisa ukutya kumazwe amaninzi ngexabiso elithotyiweyo ngoku."""
There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world.	Kunokuba khukho ukungxamiseka kokuzakhela ukhuseleko ngokunokwabo, iimali ebezinokusenza ukuba sizigcine-- noko ukusithintela ekutshatyalalisweni ngokupheleleyo koku kungaqiniseki emhlabeni.
"Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be ""the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances"" to cushion consumers and industries."	"UChibamba Kanyama, ingcali yezoqoqosho kwikomkhulu laseZambia eLusaka, uthe ukunqumamisa irhafu yamafutha kuya kuba ""yeyona nto ilungileyo ukuyenza ngoku phantsi kwelemeko"" ukuxhasa abathengi kunye namashishini."
"African governments must find a way of responding,"" he said."	“Oorhulumente baseAfrika kufuneka bafumane indlela yokusabela,” utshilo.
"It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."""	"Kufuneka kukhetwe phakathi kuncitshiswa irhafu ukuthoba amaxabiso okanye ukugcina amaxabiso aphantsi kunye nokusebenzisa ingeniso ukuxhasa abona bantu basesichengeni kuluntu."""
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers.	Kodwa uKanyama ukwacebise ukuba ingxaki yezelizwe kunye nezopolitiko ebandakanya iRussia ne-Ukraine - omabini amazwe angabathengisi abakhulu bokutya okuziinkozo e-Afrika - ingadala amathuba kubavelisi baseAfrika.
Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities]	“Amazwe abonelela ngeenkonzo afana noMzantsi Afrika, aneenkqubo ezomeleleyo noomatshini abaphezulu, anokufumana ifestile yokuthumela ngaphandle [impahla]
"like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine,"" Kanyama said."	"njengengqolowa kunye nezinye iimveliso zokuvala izikhewu ezishiywe yiRussia ne-Ukraine,"" utshilo uKanyama."
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome.	UKanyama uphinde wathi inkxaso yoluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe - umzekelo, ngendlela yokunciphisa amatyala kwamanye amazwe aseAfrika - yamkelekile.
"He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – ""is trying to offer some debt relief."""	"Waphawula ukuba iQela lama-20 - eliquka amazwe asixhenxe aphuhlileyo, amanye amazwe anoqoqosho oluqinileyo okanye olukhula ngokukhawuleza, kunye ne-European Union - ""izama ukunika isiqabu kwityala."""
"Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis,"" Kanyama added."	Amanye amazwe, afana neZambia, aphantsi kweenkqubo zokuhlengahlengisa amatyala kunye nenkqubo ye-IMF, kwaye kum, le kuphela kwendlela yokuphuma kule ngxaki, wongeze watsho uKanyama.
