DP Ruto finally shares event with President Uhuru	Jalup Ker Ruto nobedo e nyasi achiel kod Ker Uhuru bang' kinde malach.
After a lengthy absence from functions presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto has finally showed up for one - the national prayer breakfast'.	Jalup Ker, William Ruto  mosebedo kabare e nyasi mag Ker Uhuru Kenyatta kuom kinde mogwaro ne oriwore kode e Lamo mar Kwayo Kuwe ne Piny.
Ruto is attending the May 27 prayer breakfast event at Parliament Buildings among a host of other national leaders.	Nyasino timore Mei tarik 27 e Od Piny Owacho, kendo Ruto oriwore gi jotelo mag sirkal mamoko kuno.
This is the third time this year the two are attending the same event after the burial of former Cabinet Minister Simeon Nyachae on February 15 and a Cabinet meeting 10 days later.	Ma en kinde mar adek ma jotelo ariyogo obedo e nyasi achiel  higani. Mokwongo ne gin kanyachiel  Februar 15 e iik mar Simeon Nyachae, ma chon ne en achiel kuom Jotend Tij Sirkal, to mar ariyo ne en e chokruok  moro mar  Jotend Tij Sirkal ma ne otim ndalo 10 bang' iikno.
Prayer Organising Committee Co-chair Dan Maanzo on Tuesday while confirming Ruto’s attendance downplayed the frosty relationship between the President and his deputy, adding that the event provided an opportunity for leaders to reconcile.	Chieng' Tich Ariyo, Dan Maanzo, ma  en jakony jakom mar Komiti Machano Lamo, ne olando ni Ruto ne nie nyasino, kata kamano ne oreyo wach ng'ich mosegabedo e kind jotelo ariyogo kowacho ni Lamono ne dhi miyo jotelogo thuolo mar loso weche e kindgi.
"“We hope that the prayers will provide a platform for ""the leaders to reach out to each other and reconcile,” said the Makueni MP."	Jabunge ma Makueni ne owacho niya: “Wageno ni lamogi biro miyo jotelogi thuolo mar loso winjruok e kindgi.”
On February 5, the DP skipped the ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of former President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi despite his name being on the programme.	Ruto ne obare e rapar mokwongo mar Ker Daniel Toroitich arap Moi ma ne itimo Februar 5. Ne otimo kamano kata obedo ni ne omiye migawo moro e chenrono.
Their fallout was amplified in the months of March and April when Ruto skipped various Covid-19 addresses by President Kenyatta.	Ruto ne obare ding'eny e dweche mag Mach gi  April kane Ker Kenyatta wuoyo gi oganda e wi wach Korona, kendo mano ne omiyo onenore ayanga ni winjruok e kind jotelo ariyogo ok ber.
On May 4, Ruto skipped the reception of Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu at State House, Nairobi, with his aides saying he was not invited.	Mei tarik 4, Ruto ne obare kane irwako Ker mar piny Tanzania Samia Suluhu  e Od Piny Owacho, Nairobi, askeche maritoga Ruto ne owacho ni ne ok ogwel Ruto e nyasino.
Emmanuel Tallam, the Communications Director at the DP’s Office, told the media that Ruto followed the televised proceedings from his Karen Residence Office.	Emmanuel Tallam, ma en Jatelo Mochung' ne Weche mag Tudruok  e ofis mar jalup ker, ne onyiso joland weche ni Ruto ne oluwo weche ma ne timore e nyasino ka en e ofise manie dalane ma Karen.
Ruto also skipped this year’s Labour Day celebrations at State House, Nairobi which was attended by Cotu boss Francis Atwoli and Labour Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui.	Bende, Ruto ne obare e nyasi mar  Odiechieng Jotich ma higani, ma ne otim e Od Piny Owacho, Nairobi. Jakom mar Cotu  Francis Atwoli kod Jatelo Mochung' ne Jotij Sirkal, Simon Chelugui ne ni e nyasino.
“We honour and celebrate the extraordinary sacrifices that workers, households and enterprises continue to make to advance our country’s transformation agenda amid the devastating surge in the Covid-19 pandemic,” the DP tweeted on May 1.	Ruto ne owacho niya e tweeter: “Wamor kendo wapuoyo ahinya  chiwruok makende ma jotich, joot kod jo ohala osenyiso ka gidhi nyime timo kinda mondo dongruok obed e pinywa kata obedo ni tuwo mar Korona osemedo landore.”
According to the Constitution, Ruto is the principal assistant of the president and should attend all gazetted State functions at which the only speakers are the President, him, the host governor and sometimes Raila.	Kaluwore gi Chik mar Piny,  Ruto e jakony Ker maduong' moloyo ma onego obed kode e nyasi duto mopwodh mag sirkal ma joma wuoyoe gin Ker, Ruto owuon, Gavana ma kanyo kata Raila.
Since March 2018, when President Kenyatta shook hands with ODM leader Raila Odinga, and more so 2020 and 2021, the DP has been isolated in his own government, making him an outsider in decision-making and key meetings.	Nyaka ne Ker Kenyatta Mosre gi jatend ODM  Raila Odinga, Mach 2018, to ahinya ahinya e higni mag  2020 kod 2021 osebed ka idhiro Ruto mabor gi sirkal, ok miye thuolo mar riwruok gi jomoko sama ing'ado weche mag sirkal kata thuolo mar bedo e chokruoge madongo mag sirkal.
He has however attributed this isolation to an attempt by President Kenyatta’s inner circle to lock him out of the Head of State’s 2022 succession plan.	En to owacho ni Ker Kenyatta ema dhire mabor kik oriwre gi jotelo madongo mondo kik obed achiel kuom joma chung' mondo okaw telo mar ker e higa mar 2022.
“If President Kenyatta now trusts other people and consults more with Raila, I have taken it with grace. The style changed, and it is the prerogative of the President being the boss,” Ruto said during a recent interview with Citizen TV.	Ruto ne owacho niya e mbaka moro ma ne ogoyo e Citizen TV; “Kapo ni Ker Kenyatta ogeno jomoko moloya, ma koro sani Raila ema oporogo weche, mano ok litna. Weche oselokore e kindwa kode, to mano en yiero mar Ker nikech enie jatelo.”
Today’s event whose theme is a “Hopeful Future” brings together leaders from all the arms of the Government and across the political divide when the country is in the middle of a pandemic.	Wich maduong' ma ne iwuoyoe kawuono ne en, “Wan- gi Geno e Kinde Mabiro.” Wachno omiyo kidienje mopogore mag jotend sirkal  kod josiasa mag pati mopogore opogore oriwore kanyachiel sama  Kenya duto nyagore gi masira mar Korona.
The prayer meeting is being attended both virtually and physically.	 Jomoko odonjo e chokruogno e yor intanet to jomoko odhi kuno achiel kachiel.
The event that takes place on the last Thursday of May each year, is hosted by Speakers of the bicameral parliament Justin Muturi and Kenneth Lusaka and Chaired by Senate Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio, co-chaired by Maanzo.	Chokruogno itimoga higa ka higa, Tich Ang'wen mogik  e dwe mar Mei. Chokruogno ochung'ne gi Jotend Od Bura Moriw, Justin Muturi kod  Kenneth Lusaka.

The NPB was first held in 2003 after former President Mwai Kibaki took office with its primary purpose being to meet, engage, interact and pray for the nation in the company of fellow leaders from all sectors of society.

Man seeks court's intervention to clear confusion over three dates of birth	Ng'ato kwayo ni kot okonye nikech otesene nyiso tarige mopogore opogore mag nyuol.
Age is just but a number, the saying goes. 	Ngero moro wacho ni hik ng'ato ok en gimoro.
But that is not always true for everyone. 	To mano ok en adier kuom ji duto.
One such person is Francis Paul Kerre whose identification documents show three different ages.	Francis Paul Kerre en achiel kuom joma hikgi osechando ka oboke ge mag sirkal  nyiso tarige adek mopogore mag nyuol.
Tired of the tribulations the discrepancies in his age have brought him, Kerre has moved to court to have the matter resolved once and for all.	Gwenyruokno osechande gaming'a, mi koro ool. Omiyo odhi e kot mondo orie wachno dichiel ma ok dogie kendo.
His birth certificate and national ID show he is 70, KRA Pin Certificate 66 and his passport 60 years.	Satifiketne mar nyuol kod kipandene nyiso ni en jahigni 70, KRA Pin Certificate mare to nyiso ni en jahigni 66 to paspot mare nyiso ni en jahigni 60.
Kerre now wants these details aligned to give him a peace of mind and spare him the many questions he sometimes has to answer.	Kerre koro dwaro ni orie wachni dichiel mondo otesego duto onyis tarik achiel mondo obedie gi kuwe ma ok thung'e gi penjo kaka jatimore.
He says an earlier plea to the registrar to rectify the anomaly did not bear fruit.	Kerre wacho ni ne okwongo okwayo rejistra mondo oriene wachno, to rejistra ne ok okonye.
He contends that the person who prepared his birth certificate entered the wrong birth date. 	Kerre oramo ni ng'at ma ne ondiko satifiketne mar nyuol ne ondiko tarik ma ok kare.
Court documents read that he has since confirmed the year he was born.	Nonro mag kot nyiso ni gie sani, Kerre oseyango higa ma ne onyuolee.
Kerre says he was born on October 15, 1954. 	Kerre wacho ni ne onyuole Oktoba 15, 1954.
This is the date in his KRA Pin certificate, which means he is 66.	Mani e tarik manie Pin satifiket mar KRA, manyiso ni en jahigni 66.
The petitioner avers that the error in the birth certificate was caused by the initial entry in his birth certificate when he was born and he has since confirmed his correct date of birth. 	Kerre onyono ni kane onyuole, ne ondik  tarik ma ok kare e satifiketne, kendo ni gie sani  ong'eyo tarik sie ma ne onyuolee.
The petitioner seeks court’s intervention to rectify his birth certificate and have the correct date of birth entered in the register and his birth certificate,” Kerre’s court papers read in part.	Kerre kwayo ni kot okonye rieyo tarik manie satifiketne mar nyuol mi oket tarik makare e rejista,” Mago gin moko kuom weche ma ne Kerre okwayo ni kot otimne.
Teenage pregnancy, early marriages to blame for Ugenya school dropout cases	E piny Ugenya, nyiri mang'eny weyo skul nikech gimako ich kata gidhi tedo chon.
The Ministry of Education has blamed teenage pregnancies and early marriages for rising cases of school dropouts in Ugenya, Siaya County. 	Migawo Mochung'ne Somo wacho ni kwan mar nyiri moweyo skul omedore Ugenya, Kaunti ma Siaya,  nikech nyiri mang'eny mako ich kata dhi tedo chon.
County Director of Education Nelson Sifuna said there are also reports of children dropping out of school for bodaboda business while others cross to Uganda through Busia border in search of jobs.	Jatelo Mochung'ne Migawo mar Somo e Kauntino, Nelson Sifuna  wacho ni ripode mamoko ma bende giyudo gin ni nyithindo moko weyo skul mondo giriemb bodaboda to moko ng'ado gi Busia ka gidhi dwaro tich Uganda.
Sifuna urged locals to take advantage of the free primary education programme despite other challenges to ensure all children of school-going age attend school.	Sifuna ne onyiso jo Ugenya ni kata obedo ni gin kod chandruoge mang'eny, gi ti maber gi chenro ma sirkal oketo mar somo maonge chudo e skunde mag praimari. Gine ni nyithindo duto monego obed e skul, dhi e skul kaka dwarore.
"""But we also understand that life at home has been difficult especially for the orphans who have to provide for themselves,"" said Sifuna."	"Sifuna ne owacho ni;  ""Kata kamano, wang'eyo ni ngima osebedo matek e mier, to ahinya ahinya ngima osebedo matek ne nyithind kiye ma nyaka many chiembgi giwegi."""
He said most of those who drop out of school said they did not have uniforms while some said they had to fend for their siblings or themselves.	Sifuna wacho ni ng'eny nyithindo maweyo skul wacho ni giweyo skul nikech gionge yunifom kata ochunogi manyo kaka gichiemo kata  kaka ginyalo pidho nyithindgi mamoko.
Sifuna challenged parents and guardians to monitor school-going children so that they don't engage in negative social activities that could distract them from school.	Sifuna ne ojiwo jonyuol kod joma moko marito nyithindo mondo gine ni  nyithindo ma pod nie skul ok donj e timbe maricho manyalo monogi tieko skul.
"“Most of the children also live with their grandparents and you know they are never strict with their grandchildren who get lots of freedom and end up engaging in negative social activities,"" he said."	"Sifuna ne omedo wacho niya; “Ng'eny nyithindo odak gi deye kata kweregi to joma oti jo mbeko tol ahinya ne nyikwagi kendo mano miyo nyithindogo thuolo mar donjo e timbe maricho."""
Between 2018 to 2020 about 53 pupils dropped out of school while another 39 students dropped out of Secondary schools in Ugenya sub-county, Siaya County.	E kind higni mag 2018 gi 2020 nyithind praimari 53  gi nyithind sekondari 39 noweyo skul e sab kaunti ma Ugenya, Siaya Kaunti.
Meanwhile, Daniel Odhiambo, a local philanthropist, has donated over 200 school uniforms to needy pupils.	Wach maber ma ne otimore en ni  Daniel Odhiambo, ja Ugenya ma chunye ler kendo mohero konyo ji, ne ochiwo yunifom 200 ne nyithindo ma jochan.
Odhiambo said he made the donation after receiving complaints from local widows and grandmothers taking care of orphans that they could not meet the pupils’ needs because of the tough economic situation in the country.	Odhiambo ne owacho ni otimo kamano nikech ne owinjo ywak mag mond liete kod deye mapidho nyithi kiye. Giwacho ni ok ginyal chopo dwaro mag nyithind skulgo nikech ngima osebedo matek ahinya.
He said some school-going children from needy backgrounds, mostly orphans, have dropped out of school due to lack of school uniform.	Owacho ni moko kuom nyithind skul ma jochan oseweyo skul nikech gionge yunifom.
"""Most of them especially girls feel shy when they don’t have uniforms or have torn ones and end up dropping out of school. That is why I sponsored them to stay in school,"" he said."	"Ne omedo wacho niya; ""Ng'eny nyithindo ma jochan, to moloyo nyithindo manyiri wigi kuot ka gionge yunifom kata ka yunifom margi oyiech, kendo mano miyo giweyo skul. Omiyo ang'iewonegi yunifom mondo kik giwe skul."""
The ministry has now resorted to sensitisation in all forums, use of role models to offer talks to the school-going children.	Migawo mar Somo ong'ado ni gibiroga wuoyo e wi wach nyithindo manyiri weyo skul  sa moro amora ma giyudo thuolo mar wuoyo gi ji  kendo gibiro kwayo jogo ma gin ranyisi mabeyo e oganda mondo ojiw nyithi skul gi twege.
Odhiambo encouraged former students to visit their schools, especially in the villages to help the ministry fight school dropout.	Odhiambo ne okwayo jo ma osetieko skul mondo olim skunde ma ne gisomoe, to moloyo skunde manie gweng' mondo gikony Migawo mar Somo kedo gi wach nyithindo weyo skul.
He lauded the county government for initiating adopt a school programme that has been distributing masks and sanitisers in local schools.	Odhiambo ne opuoyo sirkal mar kaunti kuom chako chenro mar  Konyo Skunde. Ma en program ma osebedo katero masks kod sanitaisa e skunde manie gweng'.
"""We have taken advantage of the programme to encourage alumnus to visit their former schools and offer talks,"" he added."	"Ne omedo wacho niya; ""Watiyo gi thuolono mondo wakwa ji mondo olim skundegi machon kendo gijiw nyithindo ma somo kuno gi twege."""
Drama in Migori, widow evicted from land by sister-in-law	Tula muoch Migori, sama nyamin dichwo riembo chi owadgi ma chi liel  e dala.
Standing on her husband’s grave, Felister Wabwire wails uncontrollably as police officers plead with her to leave.	 Felister Wabwire ne ochung' e liend chwore kogoyo nduru malit sama polise ne temo saye mondo owuog e dala.
The police are here to execute an eviction order on the widow from the land she claims was bought by her late husband, Fedelis Wabwire, in Oruba Keyo Village, Migori County, 25 years ago.

The eviction followed Senior Principal Magistrate Johnstone Munguti's order obtained by the widow’s sister-in-law, Nekesa Mukhongo.	 Jang'ad Bura Maduong' Johnstone Munguti e ma ne ogolo chik ma ne omiyo Nekesa Mukhongo, nyamin dichwo ma ne osethono, ratiro mar riembo chi liel.
Nekesa claims the land belongs to her and that her mother and two brothers were buried on it.	Nekesa wacho ni mano en lope, kendo ni min-gi kod owetene ariyo ne oik kanyo.
“I have stayed here for over 25 years and gave birth to four children with my late husband who died three years ago,” Felister said.	"Felister to wacho niya; “Asedak e lobni kuom higni mokalo 25 years kendo asenyuolo nyithindo ang'wen kae gi jaoda ma ne otho higni adek mokalo."""
She said it was one year ago when her sister-in-law, Nekesa, together with her husband came and claimed they owned the land.	Felister wacho ni en higa achiel nyaka ne Nekesa odhi ire kaachiel gi chwore kendo nyise ni lowono en margi.
“I don’t know where to go with my children and I am requesting the government to come to my aid,” she said.	"Felister ywak niya; “Akiya kama anaterie nyithinda, omiyo akwayo sirkal mondo okonya."""
The widow’s son Julius Fedelis Wabwire said her mother and the entire family were evicted from the land by police officers in the morning and had nowhere to go.	Julius Fedelis Wabwire, wuod Felister, wacho ni kawuono gokinyi polise ne ogolo joodgi duto e lowono kendo gionge kama ginyalo dhiye.
But Nekesa told The Standard Felistas had separated with her late husband and only came back after he died and took over the land.	Nekesa ne owacho ne jo Standard ni Felistas ne osegawere gi chwore kendo  ni ne oduogo mana ka chwore osetho kae to okawo lowono.

In the ruling in which the eviction order is said to have been issued, the court noted that Felistas had no Kenyan identification papers and directed police to investigate her nationality.

Magoha challenges Homa Bay-based varsity to prioritise fish production	Magoha nyiso yunivasiti man Homa Bay ni giket motelo wach pidho rech.
Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha has told Tom Mboya University College management to prioritise research on fish production and how to end perennial water shortage in Homa Bay County.	Jatelo mochung' ne Somo, Profesa George Magoha owacho ne joma ochung'ne Tom Mboya University College mondo giket motelo timo nonro mar pidho rech kod kaka inyalo tiek nok mosiko mar pi e Kaunti ma Homa Bay.
The university which is the first higher learning institution in the county was opened in Homa Bay town in 2016.	Ma e yunivasiti mokwongo mochak e kaunti mar Homa Bay. Noyawe e taon ma Homa Bay e higa mar 2016.
It currently operates as a constituent college of Maseno University.	Gie sani, en e bwo Yunivasiti ma Maseno.
Prof Magoha, who was accompanied by Homa Bay Deputy County Commissioner Jude Wasonga, Homa Bay County Director of Education Fredrick Kiiru, Maseno University Vice-Chancellor Prof Julius Nyabundi and Tom Mboya Principal Prof Charles Ochola, said the purpose of a university is to undertake research for ending problems facing the society.

“Homa Bay County is known for water shortage but the work of a university is to solve societal problems.	Profesa Magoha ne owacho niya: “Nok mar pi e Kaunti mar Homa Bay en gima ong'ere to tich maduong' mar yunivasiti en loyo chandruoge manie alwora.
Let this university focus on water and do research which can end water shortage in Homa Bay,” said Prof Magoha.	Yunivasitini onego ochomre rando gi wach pi kendo gitim nonro e kaka inyalo tiek nok mar pi e Kaunti ma Homa Bay.
Magoha who spoke on Friday when he supervised the construction of a Sh300 million storey building that will be used for classes and laboratories in the university, said the young university can survive well if it focuses on fish production.	 Magoha ne owuoyo kuno Tich Abich kane odhi nono kaka igero gorofa ma dhikawo milion 300. Gorofano dhi ting'o klase kod laboratori. Ne owacho ni yunivasiti mapod nyienno biro dhi maber ka po ni giketo pachgi e pidho rech.
He argued that the community in which the university operates recognises fish as their best diet hence investing in research aimed at producing fish will make it prosper.	Ne owacho ni ji e alwora mar yunivasitino ogeno rech kaka chiemo maberie moloyo, omiyo ka yunivasitino oketo kinda e nonro mar pidho rech, yunivasitino biro dhi maber.

“However, it must invest in research on fish production for it to survive,” he added.	 Ne omedo niya; “Kata kamano, mondo yunivasitini ochung' maber, nyaka utim kinda a hinya e nonro mar pidho rech.”

Girl, 17, disappears in puzzling circumstances on first day of Term 3	Nyako ma jahigni 17, olal odiechieng' mokwongo mar Tam mar 3
A17-year-old girl from Oyugis in Homa Bay County has disappeared from home in unclear circumstances.	Nyako ma jahigni 17  ma wuok Oyugis e Kaunti ma Homa Bay, olal e yo ma omako dhog ji.
Eunice Awino, a student of Atemo Mixed Secondary School, vanished from home on May 10; the first day of Term Three studies in the adjusted 2020 academic calendar.	Eunice Awino, masomo Atemo Mixed Secondary School, ne owuok dalagi Mei, tarik 10. Mano ne en odiechieng' mokwongo mar tam mar adek e higa mar 2020, mikwanoe tam mopogore.
On the said-date, the teenager’s mother, Rael Akinyi, says she went to her bedroom at 6am, and found Awino still asleep.	Rael Akinyi, ma en min Awino, wacho ni chieng'no ne odhi e od nindo mar Awino gimoro sa 12 mokinyi to oyudo ka Awino pod nindo.
Waking up late was uncharacteristic of the teenager, the mother said.	Owacho ni nyakono ok chiewga modeko chieng' skul.
Her school is quite far from where we stay.	Skul modhiga bor gi kama wadakie.
“On normal days, she usually leaves earlier than 6am,” Akinyi told The Standard.	"Akinyi ne owacho ne The Standard niya: ""Ndalo skul Awino jawuokga e ot kapok sa 12 oromo."""
When she asked the teenager why she hadn’t left for school yet, Awino allegedly told her she hadn’t shaved her head, and she would, therefore, be ordered to return home upon reporting to school.	"""Kane openjo Awino gimomiyo pok ne odhi e skul, Awino ne owacho ni pok ne olielo wiye, to ka odhi e skul ibiro mana loke ni odog dala."""
“She further said that no serious learning takes place on Day One of school resumption,” said Akinyi.	"Akinyi ne omedo ni Awino ne owacho ni; ""Onge somo malong'o ma dhiga nyime e Chieng' Yepo."""
The distressed mother said she, consequently, allowed the girl to stay home as she (Awino) prepared to report to school the following day; May 11.	Miyo ma koro kibach nego ne owacho ni ne oyiene Awino bet dala ka ong'eyo ni oikore dhi e skul chieng' maluwe ma ne en Mei tarik 11.
Akinyi, thereafter, left for Oyugis Town, where she was scheduled to meet a staffer attached to the registration of births office so that she could process Awino’s birth certificate, ahead of KCSE exam enrolment.	"""Bang' mano, Akinyi, ne odhi e taon mar Oyugis kama ne owinjore odhi orom gi achiel kuom joma tiyo e ofis mar sirkal mikanoe rijista mar nyuol, mondo olosne barup nyuol mar Awino ma ne idhi tigo mondo okete obed achiel kuom joma dhi timo penj mar KCSE."""
When the mother-of-ten returned home in the afternoon, her daughter, who is the lastborn, was not around. 	"""Kane Akinyi oduogo dala, Awino ma en choke kuom nyithinde apar, ne onge."""
Her school bag was also missing.	Bagne mar skul bende ne onge.
Her books, however, had been stashed in a sack and placed at a corner in the living room.	Kata kamano, bugene ne oso e gunia moket e kona moro kor budho.
The money Akinyi had left Awino for food was still on a stool, the girl’s mother said.	Miyono wacho ni pesa ma ne oweyo ne Akinyi mondo ong'iewgo chiemo ne pod nie stul.
Neighbours told Akinyi that they saw the teenager leaving home on a boda boda at noon on May 10.	Jirende ne owacho ne Akinyi ni ne gineno Awino kawuok dala e boda boda gimoro sa auchiel modiechieng' Mei tarik 10.
“I, immediately, inquired from all my relatives who live nearby whether Awino had visited them, but they responded in the negation,” said Akinyi.	"“Akinyi wacho ni kanyo gikanyo ne ochako penjo wedegi duto ma odak machiegni kabe Awino ne olimogi, to ne ginyise ni ooyo."""
Later that day, at around 9pm, Awino called her mother using an anonymous contact, and informed her that she was housed by a middle-aged woman in Kisii, and that Akinyi shouldn’t worry about her.	Bang'e chieng'no, gimoro saa adek motieno, Awino ne ogoche ne min mare gi namba moro ma ok ong'ere konyise ni en e od miyo moro Kisii, omiyo min-gi kik bed gi kibach.
The distraught parent reported the happenings to her daughter’s school the following day before filing a missing person’s report at Oriwo Police Station.	Miyono ma koro chunye chandore ne otero wachno e skul ma nyare somoe kae to odhi goyo ripot ni nyathine olal e Polis Stesen ma Oriwo.
Almost two weeks later, Awino is yet to be found.	Jumbe ariyo koro osekalo to pok one Awino.
“The only thing I know is that she was last spotted in Nyamira Market. My attempts to trace her have been futile. I hope we find her safe.”	Akinyi wacho niya: “Wach ma ne awinjo mogik en ni ne onene e Chiro ma Nyamira. Asetemo manye to pok ayude. Ageno ni ongima kama entie.”
Atemo Mixed Secondary School principal, Philip Ayoo, confirmed to The Standard that the minor is a student at the institution.	Philip Ayoo, ma en japuonj maduong' Atemo Mixed Secondary School ne owacho ne The Standard ni rawerano en japuonjre e skundno.
She (Awino) has never had any disciplinary problems.	Owacho ni Awino ne en nyako modimbre, mawinjo wach kendo pok nochendoga e skul.
We are shocked to learn that she went missing from home,” said Ayoo.	"Ayoo wacho niya: ""Wabwok winjo ni oringo owuok dala.”"
Rusana's candidature causes political heat as race to succeed Obado intensifies	Wach chung' mar Rusana kelo ywarruok mang'eny ahinya mag siasa sama  ng'wech milaroe kom Obado chopo e akere keke.
he entry of Migori County Secretary into the race to succeed Governor Okoth Obado appears to have rattled seasoned politicians who have accused him of using elders to endorse his candidature.	Josiasa machon ok mor ni Rusana ma en Jatelo mar Kaunti ma Migori odonjo e ng'wech milaroe kom mar  Gavana Okoth Obado. Giwacho ni odonjo e ng'wejno apiny piny kuom wuoyo gi jodongo mondo oyiere.
Christopher Rusana's endorsement by Suba Community elders has seen other aspirants cry foul, saying the decision of the elders who attended the May 3, meeting in Kisii was compromised.	"""E chokruok moro ma ne otim Kisii, Mei tarik 3, jodongo mag  Suba ne oyiero Christopher Rusana mondo ema  okaw kom mar Obado. Kata kamano, wachore ni chokruogno ne ok otim e yo malong'o."""
The aspirants led by Migori Woman Rep Pamela Odhiambo have vowed never to step down.	Joma moko ma bende laro komno, ne owacho ni ok gibi wuok e ng'wejno ng'ang'. Ne otelnegi gi Pamela Odhiambo, ma en Migori Women Rep  matiende ni Miyo mochung' ne Mine ma  Kaunti ma Migori.
Odhiambo, businessman Philip Mwabe, former Migori MP John Pesa, former Mombasa executive Seth Odongo and businessman Owiso Ngao have rubbished the endorsement, saying the process was unfair and that the outcome was influenced.	 Pamela Odhiambo, Philip Mwabe ma  ja ohala , John Pesa ma jabunge machon ma Migori, Seth Odongo, ma yande omako tich maduong' Mombasa kod Owiso Ngao ma bende ja ohala wacho ni wach mar ni jodongo oyiero Rusana mondo ema ochung' en gima ok ginyal tiyogo nikech yierono ne olengore konchiel kendo ne ok otime kaka owinjore.
The exercise was conducted by elders led by Pentecostal Evangelical Faith of Africa (PEFA) chairman John Okinda and a team of six opinion leaders from Suna East and Suna West constituencies.	Yierono ne otim gi jodongo ma ne itayo gi John Okinda ma en jakom mar PEFA kata Pentecostal Evangelical Faith of Africa kod jodongo auchiel mowouk e konstichwensi mag Suna East kod Suna West.
The meeting held at the Carmel Park hotel in Kisii town was attended by Mrs Odhiambo, Rusana, Mwabe and Pesa while Odongo and Ngao did not attend.	"""Chokruokno ne otimore Carmel Park hotel, e taon ma Kisii. Joma ne nie chokruokno ne gin Mrs Odhiambo, Rusana, Mwabe kod Pesa. Odongo kod Ngao ne onge."""
Speaking to The Standard early this week, Mwabe said he opposed the voting idea after the candidates present refused to pick insisting that despite the selection of Rusana, he would be on the ballot.	" ""E chak jumani, Mwabe ne owacho ne The Standard ni ne ok oriwo lwedo wach goyo kura nikech joma nie ng'wejno notamore yiero ng'at achiel machung'. Oramo ni kata obedo ni ne oyier Rusana, en  pod obiro chung'."""
When contacted by The Standard, Pesa and Mrs Odhiambo said they are still in the race.	"""Kane The Standard, owuoyo gi Pesa kod Mrs Odhiambo, ji ariyogo ne owacho ni gin e ng'wech mar laro kom Obado."""
“My candidature is not on reverse gear. I will be on the ballot come 2022,” said Mrs Odhiambo.	"Mrs Odhiambo ne owacho niya: ""Pok aloko pacha kata matin. Abiro chung' e higa mar 2022."""
Rusana has, however, downplayed the wrangles, promising to consult with his opponents to ensure the region produces a candidate.	"""Kata kamano, Rusana reyo areya ywarruok manie kindgino, owacho ni obiro wuoyo gi jowetenego kendo obiro neno ni ng'ato achiel ema ochung'."""
In a phone interview with The Standard on May 16, Rusana who wants to run on an ODM ticket wondered why the change of heart yet his opponents fully participated in the exercise.	"""Mei tarik 16, kane The Standard wuoyo e simu gi Rusana madwaro chung' gi otiko mar ODM, jalno ne owacho ni owuoro gimomiyo jowetene ne oloko pachgi to ne gin e chokruogno kendo ne giriwo lwedo yierono."""
“We were all present, and they fully participated, I still don’t know what happened a few days later, maybe the media can find out from them,” he said.	"""“Rusana wacho niya: Ne wan e chokruogno waduto, kendo ne wariwo lwedo gik moko duto ma ne timore. Pod ok ang'eyo gima ne otimore ndalo manok bang'e. Jofwamb weche nyalo penjogi."""
He said with the elders’ blessing, it is all system go as he tries to consolidate his backyard before he can approach other regions.	"""Ne owacho ni nikech koro jodongo riwe lwedo, en ng'wech ma ok ong'i chien. Odwaro riwo jothurgi mondo obed  achiel, kae to ochak manyo ombul kuonde mamoko."""
The country secretary said he is banking on the support of the masses and not that of Governor Obado as his opponents are claiming to win the seat come 2022.	Jatelono wacho ni ogeno ni raia biro goyone ombul, ok ogeno ni  Gavana Obado biro sire, nimar joma piem kode wacho ni gibiro kawo komno e higa mar 2022.
“There is something the elders saw in me, I don’t take it for granted and will not disappoint their trust,” added Rusana.	"Rusana medo niya: ""Nitie gima jodongogo ne oneno kuoma. Ang'eyo ni gigena, kendo abiro tiyo kaka dwarore. Ok gibi ywago ang'e ni ne giyiera."""
“Because I am always a quiet person, my opponents have been underestimating me. I will not mind getting the support of like-minded leaders who will help me shape Migori, I will first take my mandate to people.”	“Nikech ajaling', jowetena ma walarogo kom osebedo ka ochaya. An to aikora tiyo kanyachiel gi jotelo ma waparogo machal kendo mabiro konya kelo dongruok Migori. Kata kamano, nyaka akwong nyiso jo Migori chenro ma an go.”
According to the Suba community elders led by chairman Riogi Riogi, having a single candidate would increase their son or daughter’s chances of succeeding Governor Obado.	Kaluwore Riogi Riogi,  ma en jakom mar jodong Suba, jodongogo neno ni bedo gi ng'ato achiel machung' e lo jo Suba duto nyalo konyo wuodgi kata nyargi kawo kom mar Gavana Obado.
Riogi said he is aware of the wrangle, but called on other aspirants who felt shortchanged to seek dialogue.	Riogi ne owacho ni ong'eyo ywarruok madhi nyime kata kamano, okwayo joma ng'urgo mondo giwuo kendo giwinjre.
“In our own wisdom, we saw that placing a single candidate would strengthen the community’s unity and supporting the candidate would be easy and hence the winning of the elections,” Riogi said.	"""“Riogi ne owacho niya: Kaka jodongo, ne waneno ni en gima riek keto ng'at achiel mondo ema ochung'. Mano miyo Jo Suba bedo achiel kendo riwo  lwedo  ng'at achielno bedo mayot, to mano nyalo miyo wakaw komno."""
The Suna clan, which is part of the Suba community, has been angling to field a single candidate to solidify Suna West (46,162 votes) and Suna East (46,574 votes) out of the 389,182 votes in Migori.	Anyuola mar jo  Suna, ma gin oganda mar Suba, osegadwaro ni gibed gi ng'at achiel ma chung' mondo oriw  Suna West ( ma nigi ombulu 46,162) kod Suna East (ma nigi ombulu 46,574) kuom ombulu 389,182 mag Migori duto.
With Governor Obado ditching the ODM for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Kuria community factor, the 2022 Migori gubernatorial race could be the trickiest.	"""Weche dhi twere e ng'wech mar laro kom Gavana e dala mar Migori e higa mar 2022. Nimar Gavana Obada weyo ODM kendo dhi e PDP kata People’s Democratic Party kendo nitiere wach mar oganda jo Kuria."""
Obado is reported to have mounted a massive membership recruitment drive for the PDP after announcing he will ditch Raila Odinga-led ODM.	Wachore ni bang' lando ni owuok  ODM mitelone gi  Raila Odinga, Obado osebedo katimo kinda ahinya mar rwako ji mang'eny e pati mar PDP.
The governor's point men have rolled out registration and membership drive across the county manually and digitally in an exercise expected to run up to the end of the year.

Other aspirants who are eying the seat include Assembly Speaker Boaz Okoth, Senator Ochillo Ayacko, former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno, former Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga, US-based academician Mark Ogutu and businessman Robert Okong’o.

Homa Bay health workers: MCAs interfere with health services	Jothieth ma Homa Bay: Jo Od Bura mag Kaunti donjore gi weche thieth
Health workers’ unions in Homa Bay have accused Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) of interfering with health services at the County Referral Hospital.	Riwruoge mag jo thieth Homa Bay wacho ni jo Od Bura mag Kaunti matiende ni MCAs donjore gi weche thieth e Homa Bay County Referral Hospital.
The County Assembly recently adopted a report that the acting Chief Executive Officer of the hospital Peter Ogolla be removed to pave way for the reinstatement of the former CEO Dr Lilian Kocholla who was recently shown the door.	Jo Od Bura ma Homa Bay nyocha owacho ni  ogol Peter Ogolla e kom mar telo e osiptandno. Peter omako komno nikech nyocha ogol jatelo ma yande nie komno, Dr Lilian Kocholla. Jo Od Bura dwaro ni odwok Dr Lilian Kocholla e migawono.
Dr Kocholla was sent on compulsory leave because of alleged poor management which had put the hospital in a deplorable state.	Ne ochun Dr Kocholla mondo odhi e rusa nikech wachore ni ok oti maber kendo mano omiyo  weche richo ahinya e osiptandno.
This made MCAs through the Health Committee conduct investigations which revealed the hospital lacked many essential drugs including panadol.	Mano ne omiyo Jo Od Bura otimo nonro kokalo kuom Komiti mar Weche Thieth mi giyudo ni osiptandno ne onge yien madwarore ahinya moriwo panadol.
Instead, the MCAs blamed the health executive Prof Richard Muga for the problems in the hospital, before they impeached him a few days later.	Kar keto ketho kama owinjore,  Jo Od Bura ne osiayo ni Profesa Richard Muga  ema okelo chandruogego duto, kae to gidonjone ndalo matin bang'e.
But the Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) and Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (KUCO) accused the MCAs of interfering with the service delivery at the facility.	Kata kamano, riwruoge mag  Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) kod Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (KUCO) ne owacho ni Jo Od Bura donjore gi tije mag osiptandno.
The county KNUN Secretary Omondi Nyonje, KUCO Executive Secretary Philip Mbom and KUCO chairman Stephen Obunga said changes in the management of the hospital should not be altered again.	"""Omondi Nyonje ma en jatelo mar KNUN e kaunti , Philip Mbom ma en jatelo mar KUCO kod Stephen Obunga ma en jakom mar KUCO, wacho ni kik chak lok kendo jotelo mag osiptandno."""
“It is true that there has been an issue of poor management at the hospital and that is why patients were forced to buy many essential items including gloves for medics to attend to them,” Nyonje said	"“Nyonje ne owacho niya: "" En adier ni jotend osiptandni ok osebedo katiyo maber emomiyo osechuno jotuwo ng'iewo ne lakteche gik monego obed e osiptal kaka glav mondo laktechego orwak sama ithiedhogi."""
He, however, noted that the new management should be given time“ to enable Dr Ogolla to apply all his skills of correcting anomalies which were caused by the previous management.”  	"""Kata kamano, ne owacho ni jotelo moket manyien onego omi thuolo moromo. Onego omi Dr Ogolla kinde moromo mondo oti gi lony mare kondo orie weche ma ne jotelo machon oketho.”"
Mbom argued that the recommendation by the MCAs to reinstate Dr Kocholla is tantamount to interfering with the provision of health services at the hospital.	Mbom ne owacho ni sama Jo Od Bura kwayo ni odwok Dr Kocholla e tich gi donjore gi weche thieth mag osiptandno.
“The change of management was made to correct weaknesses which impeded the proper provision of health services in the hospital. Any attempts to defeat the changes mean impending delivery of health services to Homa Bay residents,” Mbom said.	"“Ne omedo wacho ni: "" Ne watimo lokruogego mondo walos weche ma ne miyo ji ok yud thieth maber e osiptandni. Sama ng'ato temo geng'o lokruogego, omono Jo Homa Bay yudo thieth mowinjore."""
Obunga said health is a sensitive department that should be handled keenly. “We urge MCAs to handle health department with utmost care because any mistake by management of a health facility can cause loss of lives.”	"Obunga ne owacho ni weche thieth gin weche ma pek ma ng'ato ok onego omwomoree. "" Wakwayo jo Od Bura mondo otang' ahinya nikech sama jotelo mag osiptal oboth e yo moro amora mano nyalo miyo ji olal ngimagi."""
The County Assembly Health Committee chairperson Joan Ogada said their aim was to improve service delivery in the hospital.	Joan Ogada ma en Jakom mar  Komiti mar Thieth e Od Bura ma Kaunti wacho ni gin gidwaro mana konyo mondo weche odhi maber e osiptandno.
“The staff at the hospital should forge a spirit of teamwork and unity to ensure quality health service delivery to Homa Bay residents,” Ms Ogada said when she tabled the investigative report in the Assembly. 	Sama Ms Ogada ne otero ripot mar nonro ma ne osetim e Od Bura ne owacho ni jotich e osiptandno onego oriwre kendo ginywak ne tich kanyachiel mondo githiedh Jo Homa Bay kaka owinjore.
The fate of Prof Muga now lies in hands of Governor Cyprian Awiti who can decide to sack or retain him in his executive committee.	Gavana Cyprian Awiti ema biro ng'ado gima ibiro timne Profesa Muga. Onyalo ng'ado ni oriembe e tich kata oweye mondo odhi nyime bedo e komiti mochung'ne osiptandno.
Veteran journalist Philip Ochieng was buried at his home in Manyatta Village, Migori County yesterday.	Philip Ochieng, jandiko mang'ula ne oik e dalane e gweng' ma Manyatta, Migori Kaunti.
His family, led by daughter Judith Adhiambo, eulogised him as a family man.	Nyare miluongo ni Judith Adhiambo ne owuoyo e lo joodgi kendo ne owacho ni wuon-gi ne en ng'at mohero joode.
They said he was a celebrity to the outside world, and famous as a wordsmith, but was always quiet at home.	"""Giwacho ni ne en rahuma kendo rambaka mabidho dho ingresa ma tamre ginono, kata kamano, kane en e dala, ne en ng'at mamuol kendo ma jaling'."""
“It had great meaning for me. My father was never an orator both in public and at home,” said Adhiambo.	"Adhiambo medo niya: ""Wachno ne berna ahinya. Wuonwa ne en ng'at mopogore e dala, ne ok kel tije e ot."""
The family said despite Ochieng’s quiet disposition, he still played with the children, especially his grandchildren.	Joode wacho ni kata obedo ni Ochieng' ne jaling' kamano, ne ojatugo gi nyithinde, to moloyo nyikwaye.
His grandson, Philip Ochieng Junior, said he spoilt them by taking them to parks and buying them candy.	Nyakware miluongo ni Philip Ochieng Junior wacho ni ne oherogi ahinya. Ne ojaterogiga kuonde bayo kendo ong'iewonegi peremende mang'eny mopogore opogore.
“He was a doting grandfather, we were always there and fought to catch his attention and open the door for him when he came home from work,” Junior said.	"Junior medo wacho niya: “Ne ohero nyikwaye ahinya, ne walaro yawone dhoot sama oduogo oa e tich."""
Editor’s Guild president Churchill Otieno remembered Ochieng as a person who stood out as the father of professional journalism.	Churchill Otieno, ma en  Jatelo mar Editor’s Guild wacho ni Ochieng' ne en jandiko makende, en ema ne opuonjo ji gima ndiko mong'ith en.
“Many appreciate him today for being a mentor. We appreciate him for the courage.	Ji mang'eny ne mor kode nikech ne otiegogi e weche mag ndiko. Wamor ni ne en jachir.
“He built that stage into a global one and his home was no longer Manyatta but the world,” Otieno said.	Otieno ne owacho ni: Ochieng' ne nyalo ndiko adimba e wi gik matimore kamoro amora e piny, ne ok en mana ja Manyatta, ne en thuolo ka moro amora e piny.
He thanked Ochieng’s family and the people of Manyatta village for giving them a great person.	Ne odwoko erokamano ne joodgi Ochieng' kod gweng' ma Manyatta kuom miyogi wuoyi ma wuoyi.
Senator Ochillo Ayacko said the late Ochieng shared knowledge as he prepared people to succeed him in the field of journalism, which he helped shape for six decades.	"""Seneta Ochillo Ayacko ne owacho ni Ochieng' ne tiego ji mondo joma biro kawo tich bang'e obed joma olony. Ne okelo lokruoge mabeyo e weche ndiko kuom higni piero auchiel."""
“In this village, we will remember him as a great person,” Ayacko said.	"""“Ayacko ne owacho ni: ""Jogweng'ni nopare kaka ng'at mang'ongo."""
According to the family, Ochieng, who spent many years in Nairobi, came back home this year and fell sick after three weeks.	"""Joode wacho ni Ochieng' ne odak Nairobi kuom higni mang'eny. Ne odwogo dala higani kae to ochako bedo matuwo mana bang' jumbe adek."""
He was taken to St Joseph Ombo Mission Hospital where he died on April 27.	Ne otere St Joseph Ombo Mission Hospital kama ne othoe April tarik 27.
Ochieng was married to Jennifer Dawa with whom they had four children.  	Jaod Ochieng' ne en  Jennifer Dawa, kendo ne ginyuolo kode nyithindo ang'wen.

The politicians allied to ODM and UDA parties said it is unfortunate that police were being used politically to intimidate other leaders ahead of the Bonchari by-election slated for Tuesday next week.

Addressing the media in Kisii town on Friday morning, Ongwae said he had been informed that an unlawful assembly was taking place at his residence, which they had come to disperse.

Ongwae said he requested the police to withdraw but they latter insisted they would not leave until the two legislators had left his residence.	Ongwae wacho ni ne okwayo polisego mondo owuog e dalane, kata kamano, ne gitamore ka giwacho ni ok gibi wuok nyaka josiasa ariyogo oa mokwongo.
“I am calling on President Uhuru Kenyatta to put a stop to this, elections come and go. Leaders are all transitory. Democratic institutions must be respected. 50 officers can’t storm my house as if I am a wanted criminal,” he said.	"Ongwae ne owacho niya: ""Akwayo Ker Uhuru Kenyatta mondo otiek wachni, yiero en gima biro to kalo. Onge jatelo masikoga e kom. Joma oganda oyiero moketo e kom nyaka mi luor.

The governor added: “I didn’t become a governor by accident. I was elected by majority votes. This is not the way to run a Country. I have been a Permanent Secretary and I didn’t see such decisions made. This is unfortunate.”	Ongwae ne omedo niya: “Bedona gavana ok opore apoya.

Senator Ongeri said the party understands the art of winning and losing in any elections.	Seneta Ongeri ne owacho ni patigi ong'eyo gima nyalo miyo giloch e yiero moro kata mi kik giloch.
While urging IEBC to take charge of the forthcoming by-election, Ongeri said he had traversed the Bonchari constituency and was hopeful that the residents will make the right choice.	Ongeri ne okwayo IEBC otim tijgi maber e yiero matin mabiro. Bende, ne owacho ni osewuotho Bonchari duto kendo ogeno ni jo Bonchari biro yiero ng'at mowinjore.
“You may have a temporary relief that you won but I can assure you that you have lost it all. One must understand where people are coming from and where they are going. There are seasons for everything, don't try to maneuver and manipulate the result,” he said.	"Ne owacho niya: ""Inyalo mor ni ilocho, to  anyalo nyisi gadier ni onge gima iloyo, kendo mornino en mana kuom kinde machuok. Ng'ato nyaka ng'e kama ji owuokie kendo kama ji dhie.

Ong’era in her sentiments said it was shocking for police officers to raid the governor’s residence without a court order.	Ong’era to ne owacho ni en gima mako dhok ni polise nyalo monjo dala gavana ma onge barua mar kot.
"“I am demanding concrete reasons from IEBC and other relevant agencies on why they allowed for a by-election yet they know there was Covid-19 amongst us."""	"“Adwaro ng'eyo gimomiyo IEBC kod riwruoge mamoko oyie ni otim yiero to ging'eyo ni tuwo mar Korona osechopo thurwa."""

Deputy President William Ruto’s quest to infiltrate the Nyanza region ahead of next year’s elections is gaining momentum as his new allies in the region stepped up efforts to popularise him.

The leaders, most of who are considered ODM rebels after falling out with party leader Raila Odinga, are pushing for a generational change in the region’s leadership and a new economic path in their efforts to market the DP.

Last week, leaders who included one of Ruto’s point men in Nyanza, Eliud Owalo, met at a Nairobi hotel to plan what they described as their economic strategy for the region. 	Juma mokalo, jotelo moko moriwo Eliud Owalo, ma en achiel kuom joma riwo Ruto lwedo Nyanza, ne oromo e otel moro Nairobi mondo giwuo e wi kaka ginyalo kelo dongruok Nyanza.
They said their strategy will form the basis of their negotiations with other presidential hopefuls ahead of 2022. 	Giwacho ni chenro ma gitimo ema gibiro wuoyoe gi joma biro laro kom ker e higa mar 2022.
According to them, anyone seeking the support of the region will have to enter into a pre-election economic pact with them.	Giwacho ni ng'ato ang'ata mabiro dwaro ni Nyanza ogochne, nyaka kwong winjre kodgi kendo oket seyi ni obiro kelo dongruok ma gisendiko pinygo.
This comes as Raila struggles to calm a storm that recently rocked ODM leading to Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo being kicked out of a key parliamentary committee. 	Wechegi timore sama Raila koni temo kweyo tula moro ma nyocha omuoch e pati mar ODM.

Ranguma is hoping to challenge Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o for the Kisumu seat.	Ranguma dwaro golo Gavana Anyang’ Nyong’o  mondo en ema obed gavana ma Kisumu.
A source who did not wish to be named said those present were warming up to join United Democratic Alliance (UDA), which is associated with the deputy president. 	Wach ne owuok kamoro ni joma ne nie chokruogno paro mar donjo e pati mar United Democratic Alliance (UDA), ma en pati mar jalup Ker, kata kamano, ng'at ma ne ogolo wachno ok dwar ni ohul nyinge.
“We want to challenge ODM’s dominance in the Nyanza region. Our goal is to rally the region to support Ruto’s presidential bid,” said the source. 	"“Ng'atno wacho niya: Wadwaro kedo mondo ODM owe wiko e Nyanza duto. Wadwaro wuoyo gi Jo Nyanza mondo gigo ne  Ruto ombulu mondo okaw kom mar Ker."""
The politician claimed that they have the blessings of Ruto to organise the meeting with one of the agendas being to look for ways to attract more Nyanza leaders to their camp.	Jasiasano wacho ni Ruto ne oyienegi bedo gi chokruogno. Kendo achiel kuom gik ma ne gidwaro timo ne en manyo yore ma ginyalo ywayogo jotelo mamoko mag Nyanza mondo odonj e patigino.
The strategy also involves attracting professionals from the region who will help compile the economic needs of the region in a document that will form the basis for Ruto’s campaigns in Nyanza. 	Chenrogi oriwo ywayo  josomo ma Nyanza mabiro konyogi loso ripot mar dongruok madwarore e alworano, kendo ripotno ema ibiro tigo e manyo ombulu ne Ruto Nyanza.

Owalo accused unnamed leaders from Nyanza of being preoccupied with the pursuit of political power and failing to address the economic problems of the region.

Lecturer awarded Sh 416,000 for breach of contract	Kot ong'ado ni ochul japuonj kolej siling 416,000 nikech kolej  ne ok orito winjruok ma ne gitimo kode
Apart-time lecturer has been awarded Sh416,000 after his employer breached his contract by refusing to pay him salary for eleven months.	Kot ne ong'ado ni ochul japuonj kolej siling 416,000. Japuonjno ne puonjo mana kuom seche matin e kolejno, kendo kolej ne ok otimo kaka ne giwinjre mi ne ok ochule kuom dweche apar gachiel.
The court ruled that the evidence by the E-Smart Technical College lecturer Tobias Andhala would be fully adopted as the college failed to step in court even after being served with a notice.  	Kot ne owacho ni gibiro tiyo gi weche ma Tobias Andhala ne owacho nikech weg kolej ne ok obiro e kot kata obedo ni kot ne omiyogi barua manyiso ni idwarogi kuno.  Tobias Andhala en japuonj e  E-Smart Technical College.
“Andhala testified on March 4, 2021, and his testimony was not challenged or rebutted, and the court will enter a judgment for him in the sum of Sh416,000 that he demanded from the College,” said Justice Stephen Radido of Kisumu Labour Court on Friday.	"Stephen Radido ma en Jang'ad Bura ma  Kisumu Labour Court, ne owacho niya Tich Abich, ""Mach Tarik 4, 2021, Andhala ne olero ywakne e kot to onge ng'at ma ne okwedo gik ma ne owacho. Omiyo kot chiko ni ochule siling 416,000 ma ne okwayo ni kolejno ochule.”"
Andhala was employed as a part-time lecturer at the College on June 28, 2015, and by May 27, 2016, the College had not fully paid his salary.	Ne ondik Andhala tich e kolejno Jun tarik 28, 2015, to chop Mei 27, 2016, ne pok ochule msache duto.
On September 5, 2017, he escalated the dispute at the Labour Court after efforts to compel his employer to pay him.	Septemba tarik 5, 2017, ne otero ywakne e  Labour Court   bang' temo wuoyo gi jo kolej mondo ochule.
“The college was served the court papers through its secretary on October 26, 2017, but it did not file a response,” said Radido.	"Radido ne owacho niya: ""Jandiko mar kot ne otero ne kolejno barua Oktoba tarik 26, 2017,  to jo kolej ne ok obiro e kot."""
This prompted the court to direct that the case proceeds without the party that had defied court summons.	Mano ne omiyo kot ong'ado ni kesno odhi adhiya nyime kata obedo ni joma odonjnegigo onge, nimar gifwayo ote mar kot.
At the close of the hearing of the case, the court was convinced that Andhala had a contract with the college which was abused.	Bang' winjo kesno, kot ne oneno ni en adier ni Andhala ne odonjo e winjruok gi kolej to kolej ne ok orito winjruokgino.
Justice Radido further ordered that the award would accrue interest from September 5, 2017, when the case was filed.	Radido ne omedo owacho ni pesago ne ochako nyuolre chieng' ma ne ohang ter wachno e kot, Septemba tarik 5, 2017. Omiyo ne ochiko ni ochul Andhalo pesago duto.
The court directed Andhala to settle all the legal costs in the suit.	Kot ne onyiso Andhala ni obiro chulo kot ne tije duto  ma odhi e kesno.
Police in Kisumu have arrested a 63-year-old woman in connection with theft of mosquito nets which were stolen from government stores.	Polise ma Kisumu omako miyo moro ma jahigni 63. Miyono otudre gi kuo net mag suna ma ne okwal kuonde keno mag sirkal.
Police said they recovered 19 bales of nets suspected to be part of those stolen from Rabuor and Nyang’ande two weeks ago.	Polise wacho ni ne giyudo miyono gi bel 19 mag net. Gichich ni gin moko kuom net ma ne okwal  Rabuor kod Nyang’ande jumbe ariyo mokalo.
Officers from Obunga Police Station, working on a tip-off from the public, raided a house at USAID Estate on Friday and nabbed the woman.	Raia ne okwalo wach ne polise ma Obunga  kendo polise ne odhi e od miyono USAID Estate Tich Abich mi gimako miyono.
She was taken to Obunga Police Station after failing to explain the source of the nets, then transferred to Central Police Station where she was booked.	Nikech ne ok onyisogi kama ne ogoloe netgo ne gitere Obunga Polis Stesen kae to gitere  Central Police Station kama ne okawie nonrone kendo ondik kuo ma ne ichich ni otudrego.
The woman was later moved to Ahero Police Station in Ntyando, where the initial report about the loss of the nets was made.	Bang'e ne oter miyono  Ahero Polis Stesen, Nyando, kama ne ohang terie ripot mar net ma ne olal.
Kisumu Central sub-county police commander James Ng’etich said they are investigating the matter.	James Ng’etich, ma en police kamanda ma  Kisumu Central sab-kaunti, wacho ni ginono wachno.
“We decided to hand the suspect to officers in Ahero since the theft had been reported there and they had also arrested other suspects,” said Ng’etich	"Ng'etich ne owacho ni, "" Ne wang'ado mar keto miyono e lwet polise ma Ahero nikech kuno ema ne oterie ripot mar kuo net kendo  gisemako jomoko kuno bende."""
The county launched the distribution of treated mosquito nets to residents two weeks ago in an exercise that will see at least 790, 000 nets given to 1.2 million people.	Kauntino ne ochako chiwo net moseketie yath jumbe ariyo mokalo. Gin gi chenro mar miyo ji milion 1.2 net 790, 000 ka tin.
The nets had been kept in various stores, mostly hospitals and schools within Kisumu’s seven sub-counties.	Thoth netgo ne okan kuonde mopogore opogore e sab kaunti abiriyo mag Kisumu. Ng'enyne, ne okan-gi e kuonde keno mag osiptande kod skunde.
However, the exercise was halted in parts of Nyando after it was discovered 340 bales, each containing 50 nets, had disappeared from Rabuor and Nyang’ande hospitals.	"""Kata kamano, ne ochung wach chiwo net kuonde moko Nyando ka ne ofweny ni bel 340 moting'o net 50, 50 ne olal e osiptande mag Rabuor kod Nyang'ande."""
County Malaria Coordinator Lilyana Dayo, who was coordinating the distribution of the nets, noted that the theft was discovered on the day the distribution was to begin.

At least four officials from the two hospitals were arrested in connection with the theft.	Jotelo ang'wen e osiptande ariyogo osemak nikech wach kuono.
The arrest of the 63-year-old woman at Obunga however marked the first breakthrough in the investigations after police discovered 19 bales of mosquito nets suspected to be part of those that were stolen.	Miyo ma jahigni  63 ma polise ne omako Obunga gi bel 19 mag net, e ng'at mokwong mak e kuono.
The police said the woman told them she was selling the nets on behalf of an individual she declined to name.	Polise wacho ni miyono ne owachonegi ni ouso netgo e lo ng'ato, kata kamano, otamore hulo nying ng'atno.
Nyando sub-county police boss Lewnard Matete said the woman will remain in custody until Monday when she will be arraigned.	Lewnard Matete, ma en Jatend Polis, Nyando sab-kaunti ne owacho ni miyono biro bet e sel nyaka Wuok Tich mondo otere e kot.
Matete said the suspect had been uncooperative and has declined to divulge information regarding the nets.	Matete wacho ni miyono ok dwar konyogi fwenyo jokuoyego. Otamore golo weche motudre gi kuo mar netgo.
“She keeps changing her story. Police are unable to trace the movement of the nets because the suspect does not want to give information. 	“Osiko oloko weche. Polise ok nyal ng'eyo kaka netgo ne owuotho nikech miyono ok dwar hulo gik mong'eyo.
She is now claiming she cannot recall the name or identity and does not even have the contacts of the person she claims delivered the nets to her house for storage. The suspect says all she knows is that the person comes from Busia,” said Matete.	"Matete wacho ni, ""Koro miyono wacho ni ok onyal paro nyingi ng'at ma ne okelo netgo mondo okan e ode kendo onge gima ong'eyo kuom ng'atno, mak mana ni owuok Busia.

Efforts by the suspect’s kin to have her released on police bond failed.	Wede miyono ne kwayo ni gichul bond mar polis mondo ogonye to polise ne otamore.
“With this kind of conflicting information, it is not safe for us to grant her police bond. She will have to wait in the cells until Monday when she will go to court,” said Matete.	"Matete ne owacho ni: ""Nikech miyoni gwenyo weche ahinya, ok dwamiye bond mar polis, di po ka olalnwa. Nyaka orita arita e sel nyaka Wuok Tich mondo odhi e kot."""
The implementation of a multi-million-shilling project launched by Dr Ida Odinga in Homa Bay County could delay because of a stalemate between the contractor and Kenya Power.	Chenro mar gedo mar Dr Ida Odinga  e kaunti mar Homa Bay nyalo digni  nikech ywarruok manie kind jal mochung' ne gedono kod jo Kenya Power.
The project christened Dr Ida Odinga Library, Research, Innovation and Resource Centre is under construction at Ogande Girls High School in Homa Bay Town Constituency and is expected to cost over Sh300 million.	Iluongo kama ogerono ni  Dr Ida Odinga Library, Research, Innovation and Resource Centre kendo igere Ogande Girls High School man Homa Bay Town Constituency. Iwacho ni en gedo mabiro kawo milion 300.
The project started in December last year after a groundbreaking ceremony presided over by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, his education counterpart Prof George Magoha and Dr Ida.	Ne ochak gedo Desemba higa mokalo bang' nyasi maratipo ma ne ochung'ne gi Fred Matiang’i ma en Jatend Sirkal Mochung'ne Somo, nyawadgi  Prof George Magoha, kod Dr Ida.
Its foundation is complete but the construction cannot go on because of electricity cables hanging over the site.	Osetiek mise, kata kamano, gedo ok nyal dhi nyime nikech weyini mag stima oliero kar gedo.
The cables supply electricity to Suneka town in Kisii County from Homa Bay town. 	Weyini mag stimago golo stima Homa Bay katero e  taon ma Suneka man e Kaunti ma Kisii.
Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma who toured the project accused Kenya Power of failing to move the cables.	Peter Kaluma ma en Jabunge ma Taon ma Homa Bay  ne odhi neno  kanyo. Ne owacho ni jo Kenya Power ema otamore chwalo weyinigo.
“The contractor has told me he asked Kenya Power to relocate the power lines but the organisation has not done so. The company should move with speed and relocate the power lines. Electric cables hang above the site hence the work cannot continue,” said Kaluma.	"Kaluma wacho niya: ""Ng'at mochung' ne gedono wacho ni osenyiso jo Kenya Power mondo ochwal weyinigo kamachielo, to pok gitimo kamano. Onego gi chwal weyinigo mapiyo nikech weyinigo kalo kama owinjore ogedie, kendo tich ok nyal dhi nyime."""
The MP said the cost of the project is likely to go up if the stalemate persists.	Jabungeno ne owacho ni ka ywarruokno odhi nyime kendo tich ochung',  pesa mibiro tigo e gedo biro medore.
“The stalemate must be resolved. We want to see the project completed as planned delay in implementation of a project has financial implications hence this matter must be handled with the seriousness it deserves,” Kaluma said.	"""Kaluma ne owacho niya: ""Onego otiek ywarruokno, kendo tich odhi nyime. Wadwaro ni otiek gik migero kae. Sama tich digni, pes gedo medore omiyo wadwaro ni omi wachni pek madwarore."""
Homa Bay County Kenya Power Manager Ken Okumbe said his office is aware of the stalemate and has given the contractor a quotation of the fee he is supposed to pay to facilitate the relocation of the power lines.	Ken Okumbe ma en Jatelo mar  Kenya Power e Homa Bay Kaunti wacho ni ong'eyo wachno kendo osenyiso jal mochung' ne gedono pesa monego ochul mondo ogol weyinigo kama gintiere kendo otergi kamachielo.
“It is true they reported the matter to our office. We gave them the quotation for rerouting the power line but they have not paid,” said Okumbe.	"Okumbe wacho niya: "" En adier, ni  ne gikelo wachno e ofiswa. Ne wanyisogi nengo mar loko ndach stimano to pok gichulowa."""
The project aims at establishing a library with a capacity of 500 students, an amphitheatre that can accommodate 1,000 people, an ICT hub and a creative centre with a recording studio.	"Gidwaro gero laibrari manyalo ting'o jopuonjre 500,  stediam molworore manyalo ting'o ji 1000 kendo ma kar bet opangore  ka ng'as, ot moyang ne weche kompyuta kod kama jopuonjre nyalo bero talantagi kaachiel gi kama inyalo makie dwol."""

Florence Otieno says the initiative has enabled her to “give a second chance to a vulnerable group of women”.	Florence Otieno wacho ni chenrono osemiye thuolo mar konyo joma mine ma jochan mondo ochak ngimagi manyien.
Otieno first put up the rescue centre at her home in 1996 after being involved in a road accident, which left her partially paralysed.	Florence ne oyawo dalane ne mine ma kamago e higa mar 1996 bang'  hinyore e masira mar  ndara ma ne omiyo dende konchiel otho.
“The crash made me discover that life can be lost within a second. Due to that fact, I pledged to make the society I live in a better place by helping the vulnerable. In this case, it is majorly teenage mothers and the widows,” she told The Standard.	"Ne onyiso The Standard niya: ""Masirano ne omiyo afwenyo ni kare ng'ato nyalo lalo ngimane ka diemo wang' nono.

The septuagenarian has thus far rescued 38 teenage mothers, and at least 12 widows.	Nyaka chop sani, miyo ma koro hike oseniang'no osereso nyithindo manyiri 38 kod mond liete 12.
As the number of girls increased in her rescue centre, so did her financial responsibility.	Kaka kwan nyiri ne medore e kaka bende ne dwarore ni oti gi pesa momedore.
Otieno said she, consequently, had to devise new survival methods.	Florence wacho ni ne ochune manyo yore mamoko mag yuto, nono ne ok odhi nyalo.
“I set aside a parcel of land for farming. The widows and the teenage mums would farm commercial crops, which we’d sell and use the proceeds to feed and clothe ourselves,” she said.

The suspects had done their best to shake off police officers before hawk-eyed officers nabbed two of them in Kombewa in Kisumu following a tip-off.	Jomahundugo ne osetemo ahinya pondo ne polis, kata kamano, polise ma akicha ma ne oyudo osekwalnegi wach ne omakogi Kombewa, Kisumu.

This prompted police officers to mount a roadblock at Ahero and searched all vehicles from Kisumu.	Mano ne omiyo polise odino ndara  Ahero  kendo goyo peksen mtokni duto mawuok Kisumu.

The changing face of Siaya town thanks to devolution	Nikech sirkal moter e Kaunti, lokruoge mabeyo timore Siaya.
The face of Siaya town has tremendously changed thanks to devolution that has not only attracted investors in the once sleepy, dusty town but seen the initiation of a number of projects.	Siaya taon osegerore nyowuoyo nikech sirkal moter e kauntino. Kuom higni mang'eny  Siaya taon oseng'ere kaka taon motimo buru kendo monindo aninda. Kata kamano, nikech oter sirkal kuno, mano oseywayo jo ohala kendo osemiyo ochak chenro mang'eny mag dongruok.
Development projects are slowly changing the fortunes of the town that has struggled to find a footing despite it being the headquarters of the county but questions have been raised on the amount spent on some of the projects. 	Mos mos chenro mag dongruok konyo e yore mag yuto e taondno. Kata kamano, ji chich gi kwan mar pesa miwacho ni otigo e chenro mamoko mag taondno.
Siaya town has grown from a market formally known as Ahindi years ago to the district headquarters and now to county headquarters.	Siaya taon osetimo dongruok mang'eny. Higni machon ne en mana chiro miluongo ni Ahindi, kae to obedo taon maduong' mar distrikt, sani to en taon maduong' mar Kaunti.
Among the projects changing the face of Siaya is the Sh340 million Siaya High Court building that is nearing completion.	Achiel kuom dongruoge madongo maloko kit Siaya en od Kot Maduong' ma Siaya migero sani. Odno igero gi milion 340  kendo ochiegni rumo.

The county government also recently spent Sh43 million on Ahindi Gardens and the governor’s park that were commissioned by Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.

Wamalwa also commissioned the new Sh75 million county headquarters.	Wamalwa bende ne oketo seyi mondo oger ofis manyien mar kaunti madhi kawo milion 75.
The county government has also spent Sh165 million on renovating the Siaya County Referral Hospital.	Sirkal ma kauntino bende osetiyo gi milion 165 e loso  Siaya County Referral Hospital.
Governor Cornel Rasanga said another ongoing project is Sh400million ultra-modern stadium which is 90 per cent complete.	Gavana Cornel Rasanga wacho ni gedo machielo moseger pasent 90 en stediam manyasani ma okawo milion 400.
The Sh100 million street lighting project by National Government and tarmac roads within town that were part of the Siaya-Nyadorera highway project, have also contributed to the town’s new look.	Gik moko ariyo ma bende osemedo loko kit taon ma Siaya gin: chenro mar Sirkal mar Kenya  mar keto stima e nderni. Chenrono ne okawo milion 100. Gimachielo en chenro mar Sirkal ma Kenya mar keto lam e nderni maringo e Siaya taon, chenrono otudore gi chenro mar ndara ma ne oger kowuok Siaya nyaka Nyadorera.
Kennedy Onyango, a resident of Siaya town said some of the projects such as the street lighting project were as a result of the goodwill that had been bolstered by the Handshake between ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta.	Kennedy Onyango, modak Siaya wacho ni moko kuom dongruok mosebedoe kaka wach keto stima e nderni ma Siaya obiro nikech winjruok ma ne omedo bedoe e kind jatelo mar ODM Raila Odinga kod Ker Uhuru Kenyatta bang' Mosruok.
John Odhiambo, also a resident, noted there was a big improvement on the face of Siaya but raised concerns on the cost of most of the projects, especially those done by the county government.	John Odhiambo, ma bende odak Siaya oyie ni osetim dongruok mang'eny Siaya kata kamano, ochich gi pesa mang'eny mokalo miwacho ni otigo e chenro moko, to ahinya ahinya e chenro mag sirkal ma kaunti.
Walter Okello, the Lands chief officer said the county government has also started demolishing temporary structures to create order and improve the image of the town.	Walter Okello, ma en Jatelo mar Lowo, wacho ni sirkal ma kaunti osechako muko udi maricho richo manie taon mondo gikel chenro maber e taon kendo gi med bero taondno.
He added that there is need for residents with old buildings within the town to renovate them so they conform with the standards of a town.	Owacho ni dwarore ni jokanyo ma nigi udi moti e taon olos udigigo mondo ginen maber kaka udi mamoko e taon.
We have currently stopped renewing leases of those with old buildings unless they are renovated.	Gie sani, ok wami joma udigi oti lease (ratiro ma sirkal miyo ji kinde ka kinde mar tiyo gi lowo) mak mana ka gigero udigigo maber.
“Those with temporary structures that will be demolished have also been showed a trading area within town where they are required to put up their business structures,” Okello said.	Okello ne owacho ni Joma nigi ute maricho richo mibiro muk osesiemnegi kar ohala e alwora mar taon ma onego gigerie ute ohala.
Professor Paul Achola, who is the chair of the municipality board in the county, says several years ago, Siaya was just a market and social centre but it has grown.	Profesa Paul Achola, ma en jakom mar munisipal mar bod ma kaunti wacho ni higni mang'eny mokalo Siaya ne en mana chiro kod kama ji ne biro bayoe, to gie sani, Siaya osedongo.
He said in 1940s, the current Siaya town was only known as Ahindi market where people came to purchase food and household products.	Owacho ni e higni mag  1940 Siaya taon masani, ne en mana chiro ma Ahindi. Ji ne biro ng'iewo chiemo kod gik ot.
It was also a social centre for sporting activities before it became the district headquarters.	Kae to obedo kar tuke kaka spot kapok obedo taon maduong' mar distrikt.
Rasanga said that the development projects are sufficient evidence that devolution is working.	Rasanga wacho ni dongruok matimore sani nyiso maler ni wach tero sirkal e kaunti tiyo maber.
“Evidently, the county government of Siaya continues to implement projects with a view of improving the socio-economic well-being of the citizens and changing the landscape of Siaya town,” Rasanga noted.	"Rasanga wacho ni, ""Nenore ni sirkal ma kaunti mar Siaya dhi nyime kelo dongruok ma konyo e yore ohala kendo medo bero ngima ji e oganda. Lokruogego loko kit Siaya taon."""
“My government’s partnership with the World Bank through Kenya Devolution Support Programme and Kenya Urban Support Programme have since seen us implement some key projects in the county.”	“Riwruok ma sirkanda osebedogo kanyachiel gi  World Bank kokalo kuom Kenya Devolution Support Programme kod Kenya Urban Support Programme osekonyowa timo dongruok madongo e kauntini.”
Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga was put in a spot for allegedly spending more money from the county emergency fund than the initial budget in the fight against Covid-19.	Ne openj Gavana ma Siaya, Cornel Rasanga gimomiyo ne otiyo gi pesa mang'eny moloyo ma ne owal ni otigo e kedo gi masira mar Korona. Pesano ne wuok e aguch masira mar kaunti.
In a virtual meeting with the Senate Standing Committee on Health yesterday, Mr Rasanga was hard-pressed to explain where he got Sh115 million for Covid-19 related activities yet the money allocated to the county emergency fund was Sh100 million.	E romo ma ne gitimo e intanet nyoro gi  Senate Standing Committee on Health, ne oket Mr Rasanga kama diny mondo oler kama ne ogoloe milion 115 ma ne otigo e weche motudre gi masira mar Korona to pesa ma kaunti ne owalo ne masirano ne en mana milion 100.
The Auditor General's special audit report on utilisation of Covid-19 funds by counties, flagged over-expenditure from the county emergency fund in Siaya.	"""Ripot makende mar  Auditor General (Jatelo maduong' manono kaka pesa otiyo) e wi kaka kaunti duto otiyo gi pesa ma ne giwalo ne Masira mar Korona, ne onyiso ni kaunti ma Siaya ne ogolo e aguchgi mar masira pesa mang'eny mokalo ma ne giwinjore ni gigol."""
“It was established that as of 31 July 2020, Sh115,884,928 had been committed for Covid-19 related activities which was against the approved budget allocated to the county emergency fund for Covid-19 purposes,” read the statement in part.	Ripotno ne wacho niya: “Wachore ni chop Julai 31  2020, ne nenore maler ni ne oseti kod siling 115,884,928 e weche motudre gi masira mar Korona, to mano ne gwenyore gi pesa ma  bajet nyiso ni  kaunti ne onego otigo e masirano.”
But the governor said the county only spent Sh100 million and not Sh115 million as the special audit report indicated.	Gavana to ne wacho ni kaunti ne otiyo mana gi milion 100 to ok milion 115 ma ripot makendeno nyiso.
There may be an error but I can confirm that we did not spend more than Sh100 million.	Nyalo bedo ni nitiere both kamoro e kwanono, kata kamano, anyalo kelonu nonro manyiso ni  ne ok watiyo gi pesa mokalo milion 100.
"""I can confirm that all commitments were charged within the funds. There was no over expenditure,” Rasanga told the committee."	"Wasanga ne owacho ne komitino niya:""Anyalo nyisou gadier ni ne watiyo mana gi pesa ma ne kaunti ne owalo ne masira mar Korona. Ok ne watiyo gi pesa mokalo kanyo.”"
The Auditor General defended the report, saying there was proof of payment vouchers amounting to Sh115 million.	Auditor General ne owacho ni ripot ma en-gono ni kare, ne nitiere riside manyiso ni ne ochul milion 115.
The committee questioned the conflicting information from the county and AG.	Komiti ne openjo gimomiyo weche kaunti kod weche AG gwenyore.
“So where did the Auditor General get the findings if the governor is insisting that the amount used was Sh100 million? Did the report come from the sky?” Posed Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina.	"Seneta ma Narok Ledama ole Kina ne openjo niya: “Kare Auditor General ogolo nonrone kanye, ka gavana oramo ni ne otiyo mana gi milion 100? Kwandeno owuok e polo?"""
The committee chair Kisumu Senator Fred Outa however, demanded that the governor provides proof of expenditure.	"Kata kamano, jakom mar komitino ma en Seneta ma Kisumu Fred Outa ne owacho ni gavana okelnegi ripot manyiso kaka ne otiyo gi pesa."""
“We will give you one week to provide evidence that you did not spend more than Sh100 million,” Mr Outa stated.	"Mr Outa ne owacho niya: “Wamiyi juma achiel mondo ikelnwa ripot manyiso ni ne ok itiyo gi pesa mokalo milion 100."""
Siaya appropriated Sh270 million in respect to Covid-19 and related emergencies out of which Sh100 million was from the county emergency fund with the county receiving Sh60 million on July 3 and another Sh40 million on July 14 respectively.	Siaya ne owalo siling milion 270 ne masira mar Korona. Milion 100 ne dhi wuok e agulu mar kaunti mar masira. Ne omi kaunti milion 60 Julai, tarik 7 kendo ne omedgi milion 40 Julai tarik 14.
Other funds received by the county are government conditional grants worth Sh97 million, Danida Sh6 million, national government health workers allowance Sh36 million and Kenya Devolution Support Programme (KSDP) Sh30 million.	Pesa mamoko ma ne kaunti oyudo ne gin: Pesa mowuok e sirkal kendo moketne chik mitiyogo, milion 97, Danida ne ochiwo milion 6, Sirkal ma Kenya ne ochiwo pes jothieth milion 36 kendo Kenya Devolution Support Programme (KSDP) ne ochiwo milion 30 million.
Rasanga was also faulted for not spending KSDP and the government’s conditional grants in good time.	Ketho mamoko bende ne oyudre kuom Rasanga. Ne ok otiyo gi pesa mar  KSDP kod pesa ma ne sirkal ochiwo moketne chik e kinde mowinjore.
“As at the time of the audit the conditional grant and KSDP were still held in the Siaya county Covid-19 fund account and the Siaya County KSDP respectively. This was attributed to absence of approved budgets, work plans, and procurement plans to facilitate spending,” the report said.	"""“Gie kinde ma ne inono kwand kaunti, pesa ma ne sirkal ochiwo moketne chik kod pesa mar KSDP ne pod nie aguch masira ma Siaya kaunti kod aguch KSDP ma Siaya kaunti.

At the time of the audit, the funds had been committed and the service providers/contractors were at various stages of delivery/completion of isolation centres which had not reached the payments stage, and hence the un-utilisation of funds at that time,” he explained.

Stop using Otiende’s ouster to divide ODM, Kaluma warns party opponents	"Kaluma wacho ne joma kwedo patigi niya; ""Weuru pogo ODM gi wach Otiende mogol e komiti."""
Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma on Sunday, May 9 accused ODM political enemies of using the recent removal of Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo from a parliamentary committee to divide the party.	ODM ogolo Otiende Amollo, Jabunge ma Rarieda  e komiti mar Od Bura. Chieng' Jumapil, Mei tarik 9, Peter Kaluma ma en  Jabunge ma Homa Bay Town ne owacho ni wasik ODM rendore gi wachno mondo gipoggo ODM.
Speaking at Ogande Girls High School when he supervised the implementation of development projects by the NG-CDF in his constituency, Kaluma accused ODM opponents of blowing the matter out of proportion to taint the party’s image.

“There are people who take advantage of Otiende’s removal to create unnecessary division in the party. They invoke issues which never existed between the MP and the ODM party leadership,” Kaluma said.	"Kaluma wacho ni: “Nitie joma rendore gi wach golo Otiende e komiti mondo gipog ji e pati mar ODM. Gisiayo weche ma ne rik onge e kind Jabungeno kod jotelo mag ODM."""
Kaluma said it was wrong to blame ODM because of making changes in a parliamentary committee, adding that such changes were normal procedures.	Kaluma wacho ni ok ber keto ketho kuom  ODM nikech lokruoge ma gisetimo e komiti mar Od Bura. Owachoni lokruoge ma kamago gin gik mapile.
“It is normal for a political party to change its members in a parliamentary committee hence the recent change in JLAC should not be an issue,” he said.	"Ne owacho ni: “Loko joma nie komiti mar Od Bura en gima timore pile e pati mag siasa. Omiyo lokruoge motim e JLAC ok onego okel wach."""
Kaluma said Otiende’s removal should not be misunderstood to be punishment by ODM as some people are trying to portray it.	Kaluma wacho ni golo Otiende e komitino ok en kum ma ODM omiye kaka jomoko wacho.
He said Otiende still wields membership of the powerful Public Accounts Committee (PAC) committee in Parliament. 	Owacho ni Otiende pod ni e komiti ma nigi teko mar  Public Accounts Committee (PAC) e Od Bura.
He said Rarieda MP should have been removed from the PAC if ODM had issues with him.	Owacho ni kapo ni ODM ne nigi wach kod Jabunge ma  Rariedano ne digi gole e  PAC.
“If ODM leader Raila Odinga was in Parliament, he would be the one chairing PAC committee because this is a highly valued committee headed by an opposition leader. But Otiende’s membership in the committee means ODM values him,” Kaluma said.	"Kaluma wacho niya; “Kapo ni jatelo mar ODM  Raila Odinga ne en Jabunge en ema ne dobedo jakom mar PAC nikech en kom manigi nyadhi kendo jatelo mar pati makwedo sirkal ema kawoga komno.

Male nurse arrested in Siaya for defiling Form Two student	Omak nas ma dichwo Siaya nikech noterore gi nyako ma ja Fom 2.

The nurse based at a health dispensary in Gem sub-county was, however, released because of insufficient evidence.	Nasno tiyo e dispensari moro Gem sab kaunti. Kata kamano ne ogonye nikech ne ok oyud weche moromo mi odonjne e kot.
The nurse is reported to have committed the offence on May 2, but other sources indicated he was having an affair with the minor. 	Wachore ni nasno ne oterore gi nyakono Mei tarik 2, jomoko to wacho ni osegabedo gi osiep ma kisera gi nyathino kuom kinde.
Gem sub-county police boss Charles Chacha said they have launched investigations, and that police were trying to piece the evidence together to build a case against the nurse.	Charles Chacha ma en jatelo mar polis e  sab kaunti ma Gem  wacho ni gisechako timo nonro mondo giyud weche madier ma ginyalo donjonego nasno.
He said the nurse denied knowledge of the girl, adding that he was dating an older lady different from the one in question.	Owacho ni nasno ne owacho ni okiya nyakono kendo otimo osiep ma kisera gi nyako moro maduong' mopogore gi nyathino.
"""We arrested, questioned the nurse and released him.

Nyamira County leadership has been put under task to explain how the devolved unit lost Sh2.8 billion in salaries allegedly paid to ghost workers in the financial year 2018/2019.

The burden of the illegal employment that six years ago put Nyaribo in roguer heads with his then boss, the late John Nyagarama resurfaced Friday afternoon, this time round putting Nyaribo in a tight corner with the county's oversight body.

The recruitment of the alleged staff led to an increase of Sh3 million paid out as salaries every month. The said employees are said to have been employed without due process.	Jotich manyien ma wachore ni ne ondikgo miyo pes osara medore gi milion 3 dwe ka dwe. Wachore ni ne ondik jotichgo ma ok oluw chik kaka dwarore.
Committee chairman Achilo Ayako who is the Senator Migori tasked the Governor to explain how the County got to a point of recruitment staff without following the right process including placing an advert and allowing the County Public Service Board to carry out interviews.	Achilo Ayako, Seneta ma Migori kendo ma en jakom mar Komitino ne onyiso Gavanano mondo oler kaka Kaunti ne ochopo e okang' mar ndiko ji e tich ma ok gilando wach tije mantie kendo miyo  County Public Service Board thuolo mar wuoyo gi joma indikogo mondo gine ka be giwinjore gi tije midwaro migi.
“These are human beings that should be available physically.

Pi ne oduwore higni ariyo mokalo kendo sirkal mar kaunti onge otese manyalo siro wach mobamni.”
Governor Nyaribo did confirm that there were no proper records to help him trace the alleged ghost workers. “I have commissioned a staff audit process to help unearth the mess that might have been committed.”	Gavana Nyaribo ne oyie ni onge rekod manyalo konyogi fwenyo jotichgi ma wachgi ok ong'ere maler. “Asegolo chik mondo okwan jotich mag kaunti achiel achiel, kendo mano nyalo konyowa chopo e kuku mar wachni.”
The County Public Service Board Chairman Dr Peter Kereri was also at pains to explain whether the said 736 employees were duly employed or not.	Dr Peter Kereri, Jakom mar  The County Public Service Board bende ne oket kama diny mondo oler kabe ji 736 ma wachore ni ne ondik tich ne ondik tich gadier.
Dr Kereri confirmed that the employment of the said staff was done by the County Executive. 	Dr Kereri ne owacho ni en adier ni Komiti Mochung' ne Tije mag Kaunti ema ne ondiko ji.

However, he was not able to table the names of the employed staff nor could he confirm the number of the people who were employed at the time.	Kata kamano, ne ok onyal chiwo nyinge joma ne ondik tich e kindeno, kata kwan margi.
Nyamira Senator Okongo Mogeni said the reinstatement of the 736 staff was done irregularly and through collusion between the County Government and some advocates by signing a consent.

“These people must appear in Court one by one and be charged. They must provide their employment letters to prove that indeed they exist. This is a conspiracy that must be investigated. Somebody must have blocked the court process to have Nyamira residents save billions of money paid to ghost workers.”	“Nyaka ter jogi e Kot , kendo odonjnegi ng'ato achiel achiel.

"He added: ""There is no ruling over the case as it is being said here. What is filed is just a consent to end the case and reinstate the workers.”"	"Ne omedo niya: ""Ok watiek kesni kaka iwacho kae. Gima timore en mana manyo kaka ji nyalo winjore kae to idwoko jogo e tich.”"
Bomet Senator, Benjamin Langat who is also a member of the Committee observed that the County Government lacked proper documentation in almost every document.	Benjamin Langat, Seneta ma Bomet, ma bende nie Komitino ne owacho ni sirkal ma Kauntino ne onge rekod malong'o mar chiegni gimoro amora.
“We want to pin the mess on the actual sinners. Who employed these people? Who mooted the idea to create the vacancies? If they were fired, where are the sacking letters? If they still exist, where do they work?”	"“Wadwaro mako joma ne otimo gini. Gin jomage ma ne ondiko jogi e tich? Ng'ano ma ne ochako wach mar bedo gi tije ma imiyo ji?

The suspect is accused of killing Martin Owiti in Rodi Kopany last Wednesday.	Iwacho ni ng'atno ne onego Martin Owiti e alwora mar Rodi Kopany, Tich Adek mokalo.
Police on Monday obtained court orders to continue detaining him pending completion of investigations.	Chieng' Wuok Tich kot ne omiyo polise rusa mondo gimed tweye e sel sama pod inono wechego.
In an affidavit sworn by Ben Wanyama who is attached to Homa Bay Directorate of Criminal Investigations, he said he was yet to record statements from witnesses. 	Ben Wanyama matiyo gi Homa Bay Directorate of Criminal Investigations  ne owacho ni pok ondiko ripot mowuok kuom joma noneno wachno.
“A postmortem examination on the deceased has not been done nor has the mental assessment of the suspect. I pray to the court to grant us seven more days to enable us complete investigations,” Wanyama told court.	"Wanyama ne onyiso kot niya: ""Lakteche pok oyang'o ng'at mothono mondo gifweny gima ne onege, bende pok onon ng'at monekono ka be wiye ber kata ooyo.

Homa Bay Senior Principal Magistrate Thomas Obutu granted the orders.	Janga'd bura mar  Homabay Thomas Obutu nochiwo chike go.
The butcher was reportedly stabbed with a knife inside his butchery at about 9.35pm on Wednesday. The motive of the attack is unknown. Owiti’s body was moved to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary.  	Ja us ring'o no nochwo pala e i bucha ne Tich adek sa adek gi dakika pier adek gi abich otieno.

A driver who was sacked by Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology has been awarded Sh342,316 for a breach of his contract.	Dreva ma nene ogol e i tich gi mbalariany ma Oginga Odinga mar Sayans gi Teknoloji nene omi siling' 342,316  kaka chudo mar ketho winjruok.
Justice Stephen Radido of the Kisumu Employment and Labour court observed that Edwin Mutanda was fairly sacked for forging a work ticket and his argument that he was being victimised because he was a union official was untenable.	Jang'ad bura Stephen Radido mar kot mar jotich mar Kisumu nene ong'ado bure ni Edwin Mutanda nene ogol e i tich e yo makare ne richo mar chiwo otiko mar tich mar miriambo to ywak ne ni iriambo ne nikech an jatend jotich nene ok owinj.
“The court finds that the summary dismissal of Mutanda was fair. But I will award him a sum for the breach of his employment contract,” said the judge last week.	Od bura oyudo ni Mutanda noriemb e itich e yo makare. Kata kamano abiro mie pesa nikech ketho winjruok mar tich, jang'ad-bura nowacho juma mokalo.
Mutanda alleged that he was victimised on the grounds of his being a deputy secretary of the Kenya Universities Staff Union (KUSU) and for having agreed to be a witness in a criminal complaint against the vice-chancellor.	Mutanda nowacho ni ohangne nikech ne en jakony jandiko mar Kenya Univesities Staff Union (KUSU) kendo noyie bedo janeno ei ywakruok mar mahundu ma noyuag ni jatend mbalariany no.
The university, however, contended that his dismissal was based on his negligence and careless performance of his duties. The particulars given were that he falsified a work ticket.	Mbalariany no, kata kamano, nowacho ni nogole ei tich nikech ne ok odew tich kendo nojwang'o tich mo mie. Gino ma ne nyiso mago ne en otiko mar miriambo ma nochiwo.
The court found out that the entries in the work ticket were deliberate and were meant to claim a higher daily subsistence allowance.	Od bura noyudo ni gik ma nondiko ei otiko ne gin miriambo mondo omi ochule pesa ma oloyo ma onego oyud pile ka pile.
Mutanda challenged the university’s disciplinary process on several grounds, including that the committee was not properly constituted because “it was co-chaired by the VC and was thus biased.”	"Mutanda noyudo richo e i yo ma nolu ndalo ma ning'ado bura no, mano ka en kar achiel gi yo mar ne o tigo ka iloso komiti nikech ""achiel kuom jokom ne en jatend mbalariany omiyo ne ong'ad bura nyakonchiel."
He also argued that trade union officials present during the hearing of his case did not represent his interest in the true letter and spirit of unionism.  	Kendo ne okelo ywak ni jotend chama mar jotich ma ne nitie e chieng winj mar buche no ne ok ochung' ne kore e i adiera kendo gi chuny mar chama no.
The hearing of a case in which Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has been accused of destroying a tea plantation worth Sh2 million was adjourned after he failed to appear in court over Covid-19 fears.

The governor’s lawyer June Maasai yesterday told Senior Resident Magistrate Beryl Omollo his client had exhibited Covid-19 symptoms and was in isolation.

The accused was in close contact with the deceased when the deceased was still in hospital.	Gavana ma odonjne gi kethono ne ni machiegni gi jatuo moro ma ne ni osiptal kendo jatuono noduogo otho.
He was also in contact with some relatives during the burial preparations.	Bende ne en machiegni gi wede moko sama ne itimo  chenro mar iko jalo.
The court heard that the government had since conducted Covid-19 tests on officials and eight samples had turned positive.	Doho nowinjo ni sirkal nopimo ji mopogore opogore kendo noyud ni ji aboro nigi tuwo mar Covid 19.
The prosecution and lawyers representing the complainants in the case had protested over delays in the hearing of the case and claimed it had stalled for more than two years.	Ngat mochungne sirikal kod okinde mochung' ne bura nochwalo ng'urgi ni burano oseyware ahinya kendo wacho ni burano osebedo ka digni kuom higni mokalo ariyo.
The prosecutor, Sylvester Thuo, backed the push to have the matter adjourned, but raised concerns over the slow process. 	Sylvester Thuo ma e jachung mar piny owacho ochung' ne kesno noriwo lwedo wach choro kesno nyime, kata kamano, ne ok omor gi yo ma kesno ywarego.
The magistrate granted Sang an adjournment but directed that the court be supplied with a medical report on the governor’s health within two weeks. 	Jang'ad bura noyie ni kes mar migosi Sang ninyalo chwal nyime to okwayo mondo omi doho ripot ma nyiso kaka ngima gavana chalo ka pok jumbe ariyo orumo.
“The matter was first brought to court on June 2019. It now qualifies as a backlog,” said Thuo.	"Thuo nowacho kama: ""Kesni nokel e nyim doho dwe mar auchiel e higa mar 2019. Sani koro inyalo wach ni en nonego bed ni oserumo."""
“The hearing date will be fixed on the next mention date,” said Omollo.  	"Mikayi Omollo nowacho niya: ""Chieng' ma ibiro yalie kesno ibo wach ka jo ma otudore gi kesni oromo kendo."""

Nyambiri assistant chief Peter Oyange said the assailant later surrendered to the police and confessed to burning the lactating cow in the shed after being denied a cup of milk.

The cow died in the inferno.	Dhiang'no notho e majno.
Mr Oyange is said to have executed the awful incident at around 4am on Tuesday while the owners were asleep.	Wachore ni Oyange notimo tim marachno chieng' Tich Ariyo kar sa apar okinyi sama ne wuon dhiang'no nindo.
It is yet to be established what charges police plan to charge the suspect with.	Pok ong'ere ni en ketho mane ma polis biro donjonego ng'ano.
Nyamira County Commissioner Amos Mariba said there are concerns over rising cases of substance abuse among the youth that has contributed to an increase in cases of lawlessness in the county.

"""We suspect such incidences could be linked to substance abuse among young people. Our fight against the vice is a notch higher and we hope to bring the situation under control,"" Mariba said."	"Mariba nowacho kama: ""Wachich ni timbe kaka mago medore nikech rowere tiyo gi yedhe ma mero ji. Wadwa medo rang'iny ma wakwedogo timbe kaka mago kendo wageno ni timbego biro dok chien."""

The once vibrant Yala town is now in the doldrums after the closure of Odera Akang’o College campus that gave it a lifeline.	Boma ma Yala ma e kinde mokalo ne en kama ji ng'enyie kendo modich, sani ong'ich-ng'ich nikech nolor skund tiegruok ma Odera Akang'o.
When the campus that was a constituent college of Moi University was shut in 2019, the livelihoods of more than 50,000 people was affected.	Ka ne olor skundno, ma ne en bad mbalariany ma Moi e higa mar 2019, ngima mar jo ma diromo 50,000 nochochni.
The town, situated along Kisumu-Busia highway in Gem Sub-county, suffered as a result of closed businesses, deserted restaurants and vacant rental houses. 	Taon ma yudore e apaya ma wuok Kisumu Kochomo Busia kendo e sab-kaonti ma Gem, noyudo ng'ikruok nikech nolor ute ohala, otende kendo udi ma ne ji opango odong' nono.
Business people and residents now say the town has lost its glory.	Jotim ohala kod jo ma odak e taondno wachno ni sani taondno olalo huma ma ne en-go.
“A lot of traders have closed their businesses,” said Peter Adhaya, chairman of Yala Young Traders Association.	"Peter Adhaya ma  e jakom mar riwruok miluongo ni Yala Young Traders Association, wacho kama: ""Jotim ohala mathoth oseloro ohendnigi."""
“When the university was still operating, business was good. Students would do everything within Yala town. Now rental houses have been converted to guest rooms, but there are no customers,” said Mr Adhaya.	"""Kinde ma ne skundno tiyo, ohelni ne dhi maber. Jo ma ne somo e skundno ne nyalo timo gimoro e taondwaka. Sani to koro ute ma nipango olok mondo obed ute ma jowuoth nyalo ninde, to joma dinind kuno be onge."""
Those who had shops and eateries around the hostels and the university were the worst-hit.	Joma ohendnigi okethore moloyo gin jo ma ne nigi dukni kod otende machiegni gi skundno.
Businessman Asis Awan, 62, who was born in Yala town, said businesses in the area have gone down by 50 per cent since the closure of Odera Akang’o College.	Jatim ohala miluongo ni Asis Awan ma jahigni 62 kendo ma nonyuol e taondno wacho ni ohala odok piny gi pasent 50 nyaka ne lor Odera Akango.
Awan said business people who spent millions of shillings to put up rental houses and hostels are counting losses since some of them had taken loans.	Awan wacho ni jo ma notiyo gi omuom mang'eny mondo giger ute mideso kod ka ma ji nindoe oyudo lal maduong' ahinya nikech ne gikawo pes hola kata loan.
He revealed that his hardware business has not been spared as construction projects have stalled or gone down.	Nowacho ni kata mana ohande mar hadware be ne ok dhi maber nikech tij gedo mathoth e taondno ochung kendo ji matin sana e ma sani gedo.
Mr Awan, a member of the National Committee of Chamber of Commerce and Siaya branch representative, said there was no hope of businesses getting better.

Agnes Achieng, a vegetable vendor who had a stall just opposite the college where several hostels are situated, said she had to move to the market centre to start all over again.	Agnes Achieng ma ne nigi kibanda momanyore gi kama sikund nitie kendo ma ne ni machiegni gi kama nyithi skundno odakie, wacho ni nochune ni mondo odhi ochak ohandeno  e chiiro.
“I stayed at home for two months trying to strategise. My vegetable business collapsed in 2019. I had a stall where most of the students were living and when all of them finally left, my business collapsed,” said Achieng.	"Achieng' wacho niya: ""Nabedo pacho kuom dweche ariyo katemo omo fwa. Ohanda mar loko alot nopodho e higa mar 2019. Ne an gi kibanda machiegni gi kuma thoth nyithind skundo nodakie, to ka giduto ne giwuok, ohanda ne opodho."
The campus was launched in 2008 as a satellite campus with only 32 students.	Skundno ne ochak e higa mar 2008 kaka bad mbalariany ma Moi ka en mana gi jopuonjre 32.
The college did not receive government-sponsored students from Moi University for some years, but managed to admit privately sponsored learners.	Skundno ne ok oyudo nyithindo ma ne sirkal chudonegi kuom higni mogwaro koa e mbalariany ma Moi. Kata kamano, ne en gi nyithindo ma ne chudo kigin.
Before its closure, the college had received an ultimatum from the Commission of University Education that it risked closure if the management did not get 50 hectares of land for expansion after an inspection in 2016.	Ka pok ne olore, ne oridne chik gi Commission of University Educaton
The Commission of University Education had given the campus a timeline of two years to ensure all the requirements were met by February 2018 when another inspection was to be conducted before a final decision was made.	Bad sirikal ma ngiyo yore somo e Kenya - Commission of University Education -nomiyogi higni ariyo nyaka dwe mar a
Odera Akang’o College campus, which currently sits on six hectares, had 1,142 privately sponsored students at the time of its closure. 	Odera Akang'o ma sani ni e lo ma romo heka 6, ne nigi nyithindo 1142 ma ne chudo kigin kane pok ochop kinde ma ne olore.
In a bid to beat the closure warning, the college had received 90 hectares in Nyamininia near Yala.	Ka gitemo kasore mondo kik tarigno owegi oko, sikundno noyudo lo heka 90 kama iluongo ni Nyamininia man machiegni gi Yala.
The county government committed Sh35 million two years ago to help improve, construct and refurbish the campus structures and it was to offer tuition scholarships to its staff in return.	Serikal ma piny mar kauntino, noketo milion 35 tenge higni ariyo mokalo mondo okony e bero, gero, kendo loso  sikundno. Gi ma sikundno ne onego otim en yie ne jo kaunti osom e skundno nono.
However, Moi University administration pulled out, letting go all the workers who had remained at the campus, forcing it to close.	Kata kamano, jo ma ochung' ne mbalariany ma Moi University nowere gi skundno kendo ne giyie mondo jo ma ne tiyo e sikundno owuogi to  mano nomiyo olore.

Karachuonyo constituency ODM officials have told political leaders to end clan politics in Homa Bay County.	Ofisa mag ODM e od bura ma Karachuonyo okwayo jotend siasa mondo giwere gi siasa mapogo dho udi e kaonti mar Homa Bay.
Addressing journalists at a Homa Bay hotel on Sunday, ODM chairpersons from the six wards in Karachuonyo Constituency and the constituency chair have denounced clan politics if the county is to elect a good governor.	Jokom mar ODM ma wuok e ward auchiel ma nitie e od bura ma Karachuonyo kaachiel gi jakomb ODM ma od burano, nowuoyo gi jofwamb kod keyo weche ka gin e hotel moro e taon mar Homa Bay chieng' Jumapil. Ne gikwedo mokalo siasa mag anyuola ka giwacho ni mano nyalo mono kauntino yudo gavana mowinjore.
The leaders were speaking after claims by some contenders that the Rachuonyo clan which comprises Karachuonyo, Kasipul and Kabondo-Kasipul constituencies will decide who becomes the next Homa Bay governor in 2022 because of their numerical advantage.	Jotelo nowuoyo bang' jotelo moko ma dwa ni oyiergi nosieko gi wach moro ni Jo-Karachunyo moting'o od bura ma Karachuonyo, Kasipul, kod Kabondo-Kasipul e ma nigi teko mar yiero jal ma biro bedo gavana e kaunti ma Homa Bay e higa mar 2022 nikech gin e ma ging'eny.
They argued that Rachuonyo clan has more voters than other clans in the county. 	Jogo ne wacho ni Jo-Karachuonyo e ma nigi jogo ombulu mathoth moloyo dhoudi mamoko e kauntino.
Kendu Bay Town Ward chairman Justus Osumba said the narrative is outdated and divisive, adding that cannot the county has eight constituencies.	Justus Osumba ma e jakom ma Kendu Bay ward, nowacho ni mano en paro ma nyachon kendo ma pogo oganda, komedo wacho ni kauntino nigi od buche aboro.
He argued that three constituencies alone cannot make a candidate win a gubernatorial seat.	Nowacho ni ute buche adek kende ok nyal miyo ng'ato yomb jomamoko ma obed gavana.
Osumba said there is a need for Rachuonyo clan to welcome gubernatorial candidates from other constituencies.	Osumba nowacho ni dwarore mondo jo ma aa Rachuonyo osir ng'ama dwa bedo gavana mowuok eod buche mamoko.
“We are only three constituencies hence our sons and daughters who want to vie for the seat cannot succeed without the support of voters from other constituencies,” Osumba said.	"Nowacho kama: ""Wan mana gi od buche adek kende. Omiyo, ok nyalre mondo yawuotwa kod nyiwa obed gavana ka ok osirgi gi jo ma wuok e od buche mamoko."
The senior citizen said clannism will deny the county good candidates for the County top seat, adding that all candidates are welcomed to the larger Karachuonyo region.	Jaduong'no ne owacho ni siasa mag anyuola mono kaontino yudo joma beyo mowinjore bedo jotelo mar kaonti kendo nowacho ni Karachuonyo duong' ma ji duto madwaro kom onego otem atema.
“All those with desirable leadership qualities to ascend to power should do their campaigns across the county without discrimination,” said Osumba.	"Osumba nomedo wacho niya: ""Ji duto ma nigi kido mar bedo jatelo maber onego otim kampen mag gi e kauntino duto ma ok obuon-gi."
Karachuonyo Constituency Joshua Maena said politics of incitement and discrimination had been overtaken by events.	Joshua Maeno ma en jachung' ma od bura ma Karachuonyo nowacho ni siasa ma ithuwie ji kod buono ji en gi ma nokalo nene.
He said there is a need for politics of inclusivity to enable Homa Bay to get a good governor after the 2022 General Election.	Nowacho ni dwarore mondo siasa oriw ji duto e ka kaunti ma Homa Bay nyalo yudo gavana maber bang' yiero maduong' ma 2022.
“Let us stop discriminating people. This type of politics is obsolete,” said Maena.	"Maeno owacho kama: ""Waweuru tim mar buono jomamoko. Kit siasa ma kama tinde onge."""
He cautioned leaders against branding others as 'outsiders' during politics to achieve their selfish political interests.	Nosiemo jotelo ma luongo jomoko ni jolimbamba e kinde siasa mana ni mondo gin e ma yiergi.
“You find a man who has lived in an area since childhood is branded an outsider when he ventures into politics. Segregation is wrong,” Odero said.	"Odero nowacho niya: ""Iyudo ka iluongo ng'at mosedak kamoro nyaka ne nyuole ni jalimbamba sama odonjo e weche siasa. Pogo ji e yo ma kamano en gi ma rach miwuoro."""
Some of the political leaders who are eyeing the county gubernatorial include Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, Woman Rep Gladys Wanga, County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe, businessman Jared Otieno, former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, KUPPET Secretary General Akello Misori, ODM National Chairman John Mbadi and politician Luis Otieno.

The perennial water shortage in Homa Bay town will finally end after the Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency (LVSWWDA) purchased Sh200 million water distribution equipment to fix it. 	Pi ma osebedo ka chendo e boma ma Homa Bay kuom kinde malach koro biro rumo bang' Lake Victoria South  Water Works Development Agency (LVSWWDA) nyiewo gik ma kowo pi ma nokawo siling' milion 200.

Omino said once completed, the new project will produce 8.8 million litres of water per day.	Omino nomedo wacho ni ka projektno orumo to obiro golo pi lita milion 8.8 e odiechieng'.
He said the project will meet the needs of the growing population of the area residents for the next 20 years.	Nomedo wacho ni projektno biro chopo dwach jo ma odak e taondno ma kwan-gi siko ka medore kendo pod biro dhi nyime timo kamano kuom higni 20 ma biro.
“This project will produce excess water which will take care of the needs of the growing population for the next 20 years. This means a shortage of water can only occur in this area after two decades,” said Omino.	"Nowacho kama: ""Projektni biro golo pi mang'eny momedore ma biro chopo dwach kwan ji ma medore e taondni kuom higni 20 ma biro.

Omino added that the project will majorly use solar energy to pump the water.	Ne omedo wacho ni projektno biro tiyo gi teko chieng' (solar) kinde mang'eny mondo okow pi.
“Electricity will only be used where there is no solar energy. But we intend to rely on solar,” he said.	"Nowacho niya: ""Wabiro tiyo mana gi teko sitima mana ka ok nyalore tiyo gi solar. Kata kamano, dwachwa en ni mondo wati gi solar kata teko mar wang' chieng."""
The major component of the project encompasses piping of water from Lake Victoria to a treatment plant to produce clean water which is to be pumped to the residents’ taps for consumption.

The electricity bills had frequently disrupted the water supply when Kenya Power disconnected their power supply.	Pesa ma nichulogo sitima ne miyo ng'ikruok betie e tij kowo pi kinde ma ne Kenya Power ne ng'adonegi sitima nikech gowi.
“We are going to supply water stably upon completion of this mega project and water shortage will be history here,” Nyagol said.

The Nubian community has called on authorities to improve conditions at a field in Kolwa, Kisumu County, where they are living in makeshift structures after they were evicted from a disputed land.

Kenya Railways (KR) has laid claim to the land in Kibos, which the Nubians say was given to them by the colonial government in 1937. 	Riwruok mar reru ma Kenya miluongo ni Kenya Railways (KR) nogolo ng'ur e wi lobno ka Jo-Wanubi to wacho ni nomigi lobno gi sirkal machon e higa mar 1937.
The field, next to Kisumu East CDF office, is prone to floods that have made life difficult, especially for the elderly.	Kama gijotie sani ni machiegni gi ofis Kisumu East CDF  thoro pong'ga ka koth chue, kendo osemiyo ngima obedo mateknegi, to ahinya ahinya ne joma hikgi oniang'.
KR accused them of encroaching on land meant for expansion of the railway line and forcefully evicted them.	KR nowacho ni jogo nodak e lo ma ne onego bed ni itiyogo kiyaro ndach reru to mano e momiyo ne gidarogi gi thuon.
The Nubians say their eviction was illegal.	Jo-Nubi to wacho ni nodargi kanyo e yo ma ok owinjore.
They were moved to the land where they are currently living by the Kisumu City authorities. 	Sirkal ma kaonti ma Kisumo e ma nodarogi nyaka kama koro gijotie sani.
“We had lived on the land since 1937 before we were forcefully evicted. It has been tough for some of us, especially those of us who are elderly,” said 82-year-old Khadija Rajab.	"Khadija Rajab ma jahigni 82 wacho kama: ""Wasebet ka wadak e lobno chakre higa mar 1937 kae to koro iriembowa. Ngima ok osebedonwa mayot, to ahinya ahinya ne wan joma koro oti."""

Rajab said other than floods, they have to contend will mosquitoes and rodents.  	Rajab nowacho ni mopogore gi kodh ohula mayweyo udi, ginyagore bende gi suna kod oyieyo.
She wondered why they were taken to the flood-prone field, a move she said has complicated their lives.	Nowuoro gimomiyo nodargi motergi kama pi ng'enyie, gima osemiyo ngimagi obedo matek.

In the meantime, Wanga said they had built three tents to improve their living conditions and were in the process of controlling floods at the site. 	Wanga nowacho ni gisegero hembe adek mondo okony ngima jogo kendo gisechako geng'o ohula mopong'o kanyo.

His friend survived the attack but the incident caused panic all the way to Dunga beach where the fishermen trade.	Osiepne ne otony kata kamano masirano ne okelo luoro nyaka e dho wath mar Dunga kama ji usoe.
Eyewitnesses said the crocodile emerged from a nearby papyrus weed on the shoreline before it attacked the deceased by grabbing him.	Joneno wacho ni nyang' ne owuok e togo ma ne nie dho wath momako jalupono monego.
''He was attacked by the reptile in the morning in the company of others who had gone to lay fishing nets to harvest fish,” Saitoti Ayoro said.	"Saitoti Ayoro nowacho kama, ""Nyang' nomake gokinyi ka ne odhi mako rech kanyachiel gi jowetene kama gi jaketo net mag mako rech."""
He cried for help as his shaken colleagues ran for their lives before they gathered courage a few minutes later to hurl stones at the reptile as it swam and dived in the water.	Ne oywak kokwayo kony sama osiepene ne oringo nikech luoro, kata kamano ne gichoko chir dakika matin bang'e ma giduogo mi gibayo nyang'no gi kite sama nyang' nogo abal molal ei pi.
The fishermen later swam to safety at Dunga beach where they reported the incident to the locals and Kenya Wildlife Service(KWS) personnel who dashed to the scene in search of the body.

According to the deceased sister Caroline Owuor Oduogo, just two weeks ago, one of her brothers Nick Owino Oduogo was attacked by a crocodile while on a fishing expedition.

Owino luckily escaped with injuries after the crocodile attacked him while fishing in the lake in the broad daylight.	Owino notony matin kohinyore bang' nyang' make kane olupo e nam odiechieng' alanga.
His father Joseph Oduogo was at pains to come to terms with the tragedy.	Wuon-gi ma iluongo ni Joseph Oduogo, pod nigi lit nikech masirano.
He said he got the sad news while visiting Owino who suffered injuries on his leg and hand that were mauled by the reptile.	Owacho ni noyud ripod no kane odhi limo Owino mane ohinyore e tiende kod lwete ma ne nyang' okayo.
''One of Owino's fingers was bitten as he struggled to free himself from the tight grip of the crocodile’s jaws and now again his brother has been killed by the reptile. Why does this happen to my family,'' he sobbed.	"Nowacho kama, ""Achiel kuom lith lwet Owino nyang' ne okayo sama ne oyi mondo owuog e lekene (Nyang)' to koro sani kendo nyang' onego owadgi.

He recalled it was just by good luck that Owino's colleagues who were on the boat by then tying a rope responded by pelting the reptile head with huge stones and a panga.	Owacho ni ne en gima ber ni jolupo mamoko ne ni machiegni ne obayo nyang'no gi kite kod ojala.
The victim was rushed to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital where he is undergoing treatment after his lucky escape as the search for Okoth's body continued.	Ne oter Owino Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital kama idhi nyime thiedhe bang' tony ka ji pod dhi nyime manyo ringre owadgi.
Owino's sister Owuor, said her brother was still writhing in pain in a hospital bed and had lost a lot of blood due to excessive bleeding from the mauled hand and leg.

The suspects, a driver and a salesperson, were transporting the loaves of bread in 50 crates from a Kisii bakery.	Achije ariyo go, ma en dereba gi jauso, ne oting'o makate e kret 50 ma giwuokgo e kambi maloso makate Kisii.
The bread was to be supplied to shops and supermarkets in Migori Town.	Ne gitero makatego e dukni kod dukni madongo mantie e taon mar Migori.
Residents had filed complaints about the weight of bread they had been buying from local shops, stating the brand from the Kisii bakery was “notorious” for selling them low-weight bread.	Jong'iepo osebedo ka ywagore ni makate ma ging'iewo e dukni tindo kendo ni makate miloso gi kambi man Kisii ohero loso makate matindo.
The consumer protection department officers laid a trap with police and impounded the vehicle as soon as it arrived in Migori Town.	Riwruok mar jong'iepo nowinjore gi polise ma giloso obadho e ndara kama ne gimakoe garino sama nodonjo e taon ma Migori.
When 770 samples of the packaged loaves were weighed, the scale indicated that each loaf was 365 grams instead of the industrially-accepted 400 grams.	Ne opim makate mopogore 770 kendo noyudore ni makatego duto kilo margi en gram 365 mopogore gi 400 kaka onego gibed.
The inspector in charge of commercial goods weight in Migori, Tobias Nyakamo, told The Standard that the suspects will be charged with contravening Part Six of the Consumer Protection Act.

The consumer is required to fill in a consumer complaint form and provide all the relevant information concerning the complaint.	Dwarorore ni jang'iepo ojas fom moro kendo ochiw weche duto e wi jauso ma odonjoneno.
On receipt of a consumer complaint, the Consumer Protection Department will acknowledge receipt of the complaint and advise the consumer on any information gaps.	Riwruok mar Jong'iepo bang' yudo fomno, gibiro wuoyo gi jausono kae to ginyise gimowinjore otim.

The Authority may then apply administrative remedies to solve the complaints which include: refund, replacement or repair of goods, withdrawal of misleading representations, recall of unsafe goods and notices to the public on the existence of such goods.

The victims said they have also lost property, including livestock, that was swept away by floods.	Giwacho ni gilalo mwandu mang'eny moriwo jamni mane apaka oyweyo modhigo.
West Kanyuor chief Philip Opolo said flooding got worse after Migori and Kuja rivers broke their banks, and expressed fears more people will be displaced.

Witnesses said Oriedo went into the mine soon after the rains had stopped then the accident happened.	Joneno wacho ni Oriedo nodonjo e bur bang' ka koth nosechok eka masirano noyude.
“The walls of the mine had been weakened by the water. They collapsed and he suffocated,” Jared Nyakie, a head teacher at Ndemra Primary School, said.	"Jared Nyakie ma en jatend Ndemra Primary School wacho niya, ""Pi nomiyo sirni mag bugono bedo mayomyom. Ne gipodho motho nikech ne ok onyal yueyo."""
“The floods have affected livelihoods. We are appealing for relief food to feed those affected,” chief Opolo said.	"Chif Opolo nowacho kama, ""Apakani oseketho tije ji mang'eny. Wakwayo mondo ji okonywa gi chiemo mwanyalo miyo joma oyudo masira."""
He added that the floods have not halted the construction works of a Sh1.7 billion road in the area.	Nomedo wacho ni apaka ok osechungo tij gero ndara e alworano ma dhi kawo pesa maromo bilion 1.7.
Engineers working on the 42-kilometre Masara-Sori road have however been forced to seek government approval to redesign a section of the road, around North Kadem ward, that is affected by the floods.

Nyanza Regional Commissioner Magu Mutindika said 25 kilometres have been turned into bitumen standard road.	Magu Mutindika ma en jatend sirikal ma malo e alwora mar Nyanza wacho ni kilomita 25 mag ndarono osego lam.
The remaining 17 kilometres will form part of what would be redesigned. 	Kilomita 17 modong'  nie chenro migoro manyien.
“The area has been affected by floods and this has forced the contractor and government engineers to seek approvals to redesign that part of the road,” Mutindika said.	"Mutindika wacho kama, ""Apaka oketho alworano to mano osechuno ja ger ndara no kod injinia mag sirkal mondo okwa oyienegi goyo kwano manyien mar dhi loso ndarano."""
He said the redesigned road will see flood waters escape through culverts.	Nowacho ni ndara molos manyien biro miyo pi apaka okal e olalo.
“The works will include diversions and more gravelling in affected areas,” he said.	"Nowacho kama, ""Tich mitimo oriwo goyo mtaro kod chueyo motegno gi kokoto kuonde mokethore."""
Two suspects charged with manslaughter in a case where a 10-storey building collapsed in Kisii killing eight people in November 2016 have been freed.	Ogony achije ariyo ma ne odonj negi gi ketho mag nek e bura moro ma gorofa moro ne olwar Kisii monego ji aboro e dwe mar Novemba, 2016.
Jeremiah Matoke and Jeff Ocharo faced eight counts of manslaughter. 	Jeremiah Matoke kod Jeff Ocharo ne odonjnegi gi ketho mar nego ji aboro.
They were accused that on November 10, 2016, at Kisii Municipality block 111/236 in Kisii town, they unlawfully and negligently caused the deaths of the eight people.

The then National Construction Authority regional manager, Lucas Adwera, testified that they visited the site in July 2016 and found out that there was a lack of compliance and immediately issued a suspension notice.

The accused persons, however, denied the offences saying they were not the developers of the said property.	Achije mane odonjnigo notamora kethogo ka giwacho ni ok gin e weg odno.

East African Community (EAC) recently named President Ndayishimiye as rapporteur while President Kenyatta was chosen as the community’s chairperson.	Riwruok mar East African Community (EAC) nyocha oketo Ker Ndayishimiye obedo itgi kod dhoggi to Ker Kenyatta ne oyier obed jakom.
In June 2020, President Kenyatta congratulated Ndayishimiye on his election as President and pledged to work with him, saying Burundi was Kenya’s valued development partner.	E higa mar 2020 dwe mar auchil, Ker Kenyatta ne opwoyo Ndayishimiye ka oyiero obedo Ker kendo ne osingore ni odhi tiyo kode kowacho ni Burundi en osiep Kenya e timo gik makelo dongruok.
The visit comes after a similar one to Uganda on May 13 to woo Ugandan investors to invest in Burundi.	Noyudo oselimo piny Uganda tarik 13 dwe mar abich wuoyo gi jo ohala man Uganda mondo otim ohala gi piny Burundi.
This year’s Madaraka Day celebrations will be an invite-only event as part of the Covid-19 measures.	Jogo madhi betie e nyasi mar Madaraka mitimo higani gin mana joma ogwel kende nikech chike mag Covid-19.
Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said only 3,000 guests have been invited to attend the celebrations.	Gavana ma Kisumu, Anyang' Nyong'o nowacho ni ogwel welo 3,000 kende mondo odhi e nyasino.
“Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium can accommodate 35,000 people, however, we have only invited 3,000 which is about 10 per cent of the entire capacity. This is in line with the Covid-19 protocols,” said Governor Nyong’o.	"Gavana Nyong'o nowacho kama, ""Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium nyalo ting'o ji 35,000, kata kamano, wagwelo mana ji 3,000 ma en chiegni pasent apar mar kwan duto. Ma en ka luwore gi chike mag Covid-19."""
This is the first time Kisumu will host a national ceremony.	Ma e kinde mokwongo ma Kisumu ohangoe bedo kama itimoe nyasi mokwako piny.
Previously, the holidays were presided over in Nairobi until the Jubilee regime revised the trend to rotate the celebrations in counties.	E kinde mokalo, nyasi kaka mago ne itimoga Nairobi kata kamano, sirkand Jubilee ne oloko mondo kama itomoe nyasino olworre e kaonti mopogore opogore.
Madaraka Day is celebrated every year on June 1 to commemorate the day Kenya attained internal self-rule in 1963 after colonisation from Britain.	Nyasi mar Madaraka itimoga higa ka higa tarik 1 dwe mar auchiel ka iparogo odiechieng' ma Kenya nochako bedo gi loch margi giwegi e higa mar 1963 bang' bedo e bwo loch jo Britain.
Rescue efforts on following collapse of county building in Nyamira	Kinda mar reso joma ot oruombore kuomgi Nyamira
Rescuers were last evening working against time to find survivors after the collapse of a Nyamira County Assembly building that was under construction.	Nyoro godhiambo ne ji pod manyo joma otony bang' ka ot ma ne pod igero ruombore piny, ot ma dhi bedo Od Bura mar Kaonti ma Nyamira.
By 6.30pm, 25 workers out of 35 that were working at the site before it came tumbling down had been rescued.	Ka ne ochopo sa apar gariyo gi nus odhiambo, ne oseres jotich 25 kuom 35 mane tiyo kanyo kane odno pok oruombore piny.
The building at the county assembly collapsed minutes past 5pm.	Odno mantie kama od bura mar kaonti nitie ne oruombore piny dakika matin tok sa apar gachiel.
Nyamira County Commissioner Gikaro Mariba told The Standard on phone that authorities were doing all they could to rescue those trapped.	Jatend sirikal ma malo ma Nyamira (County Commissioner) Gikaro Mariba ne onyiso The Standard e simo ni gitemo kar nyalogi mondo gires ji duto momoko.
"""The rescue mission is ongoing. Locals and a combined team of government rescuers are on site to help those trapped,"" Mariba said."	"Mariba nowacho niya, ""Chenro mar reso ji dhi nyime. Raia kod jo sirkal ni kama ot nopodhoe mondo gikony joma pod omoko."""
The staircase to the four-storey building collapsed as the workers prepared to leave the site after the day's work.	Ngas ma ihidho go odno ne olwar sama jotich ne ikore mar wuok bang' tieko tijgi ma odiechieng'no.
The main road in Kitutu Masaba constituency has for a long time been used as a political carrot to woo locals into voting for politicians who pledge to tarmac it.	Ndara maduong mantie Kitutu Masaba osetigo nyading'eny gi josiasa ka gitemo sero ji ogonegi ombulu mondo gigo ndarano lam.
For over three decades, the Amabuko-Rigoma-Magombo-Kemera road has made and unmade politicians, as many have used it as a campaign tool.	Kuom higni mang'eny, ndara mar Amabuko-Rigoma-Magomba-Kemera osemiyo josiasa oyudo loch to moko opodho nikech gitiyo kode e timo kampen.
Nearly all the MPs who have been elected from Kitutu Masaba have pledged to have the road tarmacked from Kemera town, where it connects with the Kisii-Nyamira-Chemosit road to Amabuko shopping centre where it joins the Kisii-Keroka-Sotik-Nairobi highway.	Chiegni ni Jood Bura duto moseyier Kitutu Masaba osega singore ni gidhi goyo ndarano lam kowuok taon mar Kemera kama oromoe gi ndara mar Kisii-Nyamira-Chemosit modhi nyaka chiro mar Amabuko ma orade gi ndara maduong' mar Kisii-Keroka-Sotik-Nairobi.
It is not only MPs who have used the road as a political tool to win votes from residents; other leaders who have been eyeing other political seats have also used it.	To ok en Jood Bura kende ema osekampen ka gitiyo gi ndarano mondo ji ogonegi ombulu, nitie jotelo mamoko ma be osetiyo kode.
The late President Daniel Moi, retired President Mwai Kibaki and President Uhuru Kenyatta all used it as a campaign tool.	Ker mane osetho Daniel Moi, Ker machon Mwai Kibaki kod Ker Uhuru Kenyatta notiyo gi wach loso ndarano e kampen ma ne gitimo.
During Moi’s era, the road was marked for upgrading to bitumen standard but this did not happen because of the political winds of the time. Former area MP, the late George Anyona, became a fierce critic of Moi.	E ndalo Moi, ne osechan ni idhi go ndarano lam, kata kamano, mano ne ok otimore ka luwore gi weche siasa ma ne nitie e ndalono. Jaod Bura machon mosenindo George Anyano ne kwedo mager loch Moi.
At one time, Anyona had promised to repair the road but because of lack of political goodwill from the government, that did not happen.	Nitie kinde moro ma Anyona ne owacho ni odhi loso ndarano, kata kamano, nikech ok owinjre gi sirkal ne ok omiye pesa.
President Kibaki also pledged to have it finished around 2010, but the road was never upgraded.	Ker Kibaki be nowacho ni ne odhi tieko loso ndarano e higa mar 2010, to mano ne ok otimore.
Having the road tarmacked remained a pipe dream until 2013 when the work began.	Goyo ndarano lam ne obed lek nyaka e higa mar 2013 ka ne tij lose ochakore.
Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto, while campaigning in 2013 ahead of the General Election, also earmarked the project for construction.	Uhuru kod Jalupne William Ruto ka ne gitimo kampen 2013 ka yiero pok ochopo, ne giwacho ni gidhi loso ndarano.
And in 2017, construction works on the road stalled at Gekano Tea Buying Centre after the contractor terminated the works.	E higa mar 2017, tij gero ndarano ne ochung' gi alwora mar Gekano Tea Buying Centre bang' ka ngama ne omi orak mar lose weyo tich.
The other section near River Gucha bridge and a 15-kilometre stretch remain incomplete.	Kuonde ma ne odong' ma ok otiek los e ndarano gin alwora man machiegni gi olalo mar Aora Gucha kod kama romo kilomita 15.
Area MP Shadrack Mose has been fighting to have the road completed before his term expires. His plan seems to succeed as a contractor is already the site to do the job.	Jaod Bura makanyo Shadrack Mose osebedo kakedo matek mondo otiek loso ndarano ka pok owuok e loch. Chenroneno dhi ka tiyo nikech nitie jagedo ma osechako tij loso ndarano.
Currently, survey works are being carried out by a Chinese company, which was given the contract.	Tij survey e ndarano ne omi kambi moro mar Jo-China.
“This is a very important road, which no one can ignore. Tea farmers in the area have faced difficulties in transporting their produce to the factories because of the poor state of the road. Such challenges will soon be a thing of the past,” Mose said.	"Mose nowacho kama, ""Ma ndara maduong' ma ok onego ojwang'. Jopur ma odak e alworani chandore gi kaka ginyalo kowegi gik ma gikayo e kembe nikech ndara rach. Machiegnini, chandruogego biro rumo."""
Residents say completion of the road will give the area MP an upper hand in the 2022 polls.	Jodak wacho ni ka otiek loso ndarano to mano biro konyo Jaod Burano e yiero mar 2022.
“Mose will have higher chances of re-election if he pushes the government to finish the project before next year,” said Peter Mokua, a resident of Gekano. 	"Peter Mokua modak Gekano, wacho kama, ""Ka Mose okaso sirkal motieko loso ndarani ka higa manyien pok ochopo, mano nyalo miyo oyiere kendo."""
Oscars pushed back to April 2021 as film industry scrambles to adapt amid coronavirus	Mich mag Oscar ochwal nyaka April 2021 sama kembe maloso sinema pod nyagore gi tich e kinde tuo corona
Film's most prestigious award has had to be postponed after the industry took a major blow amid coronavirus.	Ne ochuno mondo ochor Mich mag Oscar bang' ka josinembe noromo gi chandruoge mang'eny nikech corona.
The Oscars ceremony for 2021 has been shifted back by nearly two months after the majority of films since March this year had to be put on hold.	Nyasi mag chiwo mich Oscar e higa mar 2021 ne olok tarige gi dweche ariyo bang' ka thoth sinembe ma chakore Mach higani ne ochung.
It has been moved from a February 28th to an April 25th date.This move should accommodate early 2021 releases, delayed because of the pandemic.	Tarik owil kowuok e 28 dwe mar ariyo modhi tarik 25 dwe mar agwen. Mano dhi konyo sinembe mane ogol chak higani nikech tuo mar corona.
President of the Academy, David Rubin, and CEO Dawn Hudson, said of their decision: “For over a century, movies have played an important role in comforting, inspiring and entertaining us during the darkest of times.	"Ker mar Akedemino, David Rubin kod CEO Dawn Hudson, nowacho kama, ""Kuom higni mokalo mia achiel, sinembe osekonyo ahinya e hoyo, jiwo kendo moro chuny ji sama weche tek."
"""Our hope, in extending the eligibility period and our awards date, is to provide the flexibility filmmakers need to finish and release their films without being penalized for something beyond anyone's control."""	"Dwarowa maduong' sama wachoro nyime tarik mar chiwo mich, en ni mondo okony jolos sinema obed gi thuolo moromo mar tieko loso sinembegi ma ok gogi fain ne gima onge kaka ne ginyalo timo."""
The new date’s means nominations will be announced on March 15th 2021, with the submission deadline for general entry categories (which includes Best Picture) on January 15th.	Tarik manyien mochiwno nyiso ni ibiro yier jopiem tarik 15 Mach, 2021, to tarik mogik ma gibiro kawoe nyinge joma piem ne mich (moriwo mich Picha Maber) biro bedo Januar 15.
It is yet another blow to music fans as Kenya mourns popular Benga artiste Erick Omondi who died of cancer in Bondo, Siaya County on Tuesday morning.	Jo-Kenya nigi kuyo mang'eny kendo nikech jathum machielo mar Benga otho, miluongo ni Erick Omondi. Kansa onege Tich Ariyo okinyi Bondo, Siaya Kaonti.
"The death of the ex-member of the legendary Nabi Kings Band popularly referred to by his fans as ""Long Lilo"" has gutted his fans."	"Tho mar jathum ma chon ni e grup miluongo ni Nabi Kings Band ma ne ong'ere gi nying mar ""Long' Lilo"" oweyo ji kuyo."
The 37-year-old father of three died at 4:30 am while undergoing treatment at Bondo Sub-County Hospital.	Nojahigni 37 kendo ne en gi nyithindo adek. Notho kar sa apar gi nus okinyi e kama nithiedhe e Bondo Sub-County Hospital.
His wife Goretty Awino and family spokesperson Olima Gondi confirmed the death.	Chiege, Goretty Awino kod Olima Gondi mawuoyo e lo-gi ema nowacho ripod thone.
Long Lilo thrilled his fans with his husky voice and engaging lyrics during his prime days when he sang alongside Osito Kalle, another legendary Luo Benga icon who trained him.	Long' Lilo ne moro chuny joherane gi dwonde mamit kod kaka nower ndalo mane ower kanyachiel gi Osito Kalile, ma be Ja-Benga mong'ere kendo ma ne otiege.
Some of his hit songs include Goretti Awino, Were wuod Ogalo, Okoth Mang’ang’a, Kong’o shida, Anita Nyausonga , Thomas Mwaya and any more. In his song Japuonj, Omondi praises Osito Kalle for his ability to nurture other singers like himself, Odhiambo Tusker, Aluoch Pamba, Atommy Sifa, Ogina Koko (currently Ramogi FM presenter) and many others. 	Moko kuom wendege mong'ere gin Goretti Awino, Were wuod Ogalo, Okoth Mang'ang'a, Kong'o shida, Anita Nyausonga, Thomas Mwaya kod mamoko mang'eny. E wer miluongo ni Japuonj, Omondi pako Osito Kalile nikech nokonye kod jower mamoko kaka Odhiambo Tusker, Aluoch Pamba, Atommy Sifa, Ogina Koko (ma sani en jalendo e redio) kod jomamoko mang'eny.
Odhiambo Tusker after graduating from the hands of Osito composed a hit song Jopuonj, a piece which praised the efforts of teachers in the society and received widespread acclamation among the Luo fan base.	Odhiambo Tusker bang' tieko tiegruok e lwet Osito, ne owero wer mong'ere ni Jopuonj, wendno ne opwoyo kinda ma jopuonje timo kendo ji mang'eny nohero werno e joherana ma Joluo.
Osito who mentored them also starred with other songs such as Lesna buoyo ma wiye, Asembo piny maber, Jaber jaula and much more.	Osito ma ne opuonjo gino en be nowero wende kaka Lesna Bwoyo ma Wiye, Asembo Piny Maber, Jaber Jaula kod mamoko.
Long’Lilo was reportedly ill with cancer for a long time and at some point was appealing for medical help.	Kansa ne osebedo ka tuoyo Long' Lilo kuom kinde malach ma kata nitie ndalo moro ma ne okwayo mondo ji okonye.
His death comes barely a week after Luo Ohangal fans were shocked with the sudden death of Abenny Jachiga who died in Kisumu abruptly and was buried with less than 48 yours against the wishes of his fans.	Tho mare otimore ka kata juma achiel ema pok orumo are Joluo mohero Ohangla winj ni Abenny Jachiga otho apoya nono Kisumu kendo noyike mapiyo gi seche 48 mopogore gi dwach joherane.
Nothing shakes the conscience of mankind than an unexplained death of a celebrity.	Onge gima chandoga chuny oganda moloyo tho apoya mar ng'at ma nigi huma.
Ken Walibora was not your ordinary celebrity pushed to fame by benevolent spirits.	Ken Walibora ne en ng'at ma nigi huma nikech weche mopogore.
At the time of his death, he was one of the most celebrated Swahili writers in Kenya and one of the universally acclaimed authors.	Ne otho ka en achiel kuom jondiko mong'ere mag buge Kiswahili to bende nomiye luor kaka jandiko e piny ngima.
Lovers of literature are pained not just by his death but the brutal manner in which it came. 	Jogo mohero somo buge winjo marach ahinya nikech tho mare kod kaka notho malit.
Such death is reserved for troublesome characters in literary works.	Thoye ma kamago yudorega mana e buge kiwuoyo kuom joma ne ok beyo.
In such extra ordinary circumstances, the people of Khabondi would seek solace in the emotive Luhya dirge “Olumbe luno toto lwakhabere lurungungwa, mana lukhaya khwira, ndakhaluwere ing’ombe!” translated to mean “If death could be paid to spare someone, I would have given death a cow”.	"Sama weche kaka mano otimore, Jo-Luhya nigi wer moro ma wacho kama, “Olumbe luno toto lwakhabere lurungungwa, mana lukhaya khwira, ndakhaluwere ing’ombe!” ma tiende kolok en ""Ka dine inyalo chul tho mondo owe ng'ato, dine amiyo tho dhiang'."""
Admittedly, I have never physically met Walibora.	An ne pok aromo gi Walibora wang' gi wang'.
I first knew him in Standard Seven in primary school when my Kiswahili teacher Peter Busolo insisted that I read Siku Njema and explain the synopsis to him in seven days.	Nakwongo winjo nyinge ka an e klas abiriyo e kinde mane japuonjna mar Kiswahili nochika ni asom bug 'Siku Njema' kae to alerne gima bugno wuoye bang' odiechienge abiriyo.
By that time, Siku Njema was a compulsory Kiswahili set book in secondary school, but here was a village-bred juvenile being asked to interpret it.	Ndalono, bug Siku Njema ne isomo e sekondari kata kamano, an to ne pod an nyathi primary to ema inyisa ni asom bugno.
Mr Busolo understood the kind of books that would inspire students’ passion.	Mr Busolo ne ong'eyo buge mane nyalo miyo nyithindo oher somo.
That was the last time he asked me to read any of Walibora’s books. 	Mano e kinde mogik ma ne okwaya mondo asom buge Walibora.
I took it upon myself to monitor the author’s publications and read them. 	Bang'e, nachako manyo buge mamoko mag Walibora mondo asom.
Walibora was a gifted story teller who understood an African village with magic.	Walibora ne ong'eyo gano sigana mamit kendo nong'eyo timbe Jo Afrika.
Our continuous interaction has been through his works.	Wang'eye mana kokalo kuom buge mondiko.
His characters lived among us.	Ne chalo mana ka gima wadak gi joma wuoyo e bugene.
Walibora wrote about things that we could see in our daily lives as students. Most of his characters were an inspiration. 	Joma Walibora ne ondiko e bugene ne gin joma waneno e ngimawa mapile kaka jopuonjre. Thoth jogo ne jiwowaga.
I drew quite a number of lessons from Walibora’s works that have guided me to date.	Nitie puonj mang'eny ma ne ayudo e buge Walibora mosetayo ngimana nyaka sani.
In his master piece Siku Njema, Walibora demystifies the long held African concept of illegitimate children with a single phrase “Mwanaharamu hamna, kitendo ndicho cha haramu” to mean “there is no illegitimate child, it is the act that is illegitimate”.	"E buk mane ondiko mong'ere ni Siku Njema, Walibora nokwedo paro monya ma ji nigo e wi nyithindo ma minasi kowacho kama, “Mwanaharamu hamna, kitendo ndicho cha haramu” ma tiende en, ""Onge nyathi ma ok owinjore onyuol, tim miyudego ema ok owinjore."""
Walibora’s main character in Siku Njema, Msanifu Kombo happens to be such a child. Through him, we are exposed to traumatising experiences that single mothers and their children go through.	Jal miwuoyo kuome ahinya e Siku Njema iluongo ni Msanifu Kombo kende en be ne nyathi ma ne onyuol kamano. Kokalo kuom sigande, ileronwa chandruoge ma mine modak kendgi kaloe kod nyithindgi.
The contempt with which society treats such children, and above all, their determination to succeed amid such challenges.	Ileronwa bende kaka joma odak e alwora kwedoga nyithindo ma kamago kod kaka nyithindogo nyagore.
Perhaps it is because of his humble upbringing or the strict Christian upbringing under Jehova’s Witness denomination.	Nyalo bedo ni gima konyo Walibora ndiko buge mabeyo kamano en nikech nopon e od joma oluoro Nyasaye e din mar Jehovah's Witness kata Joneno mag Jehova.
In my teaching of Children Law, I have found myself citing Walibora more than any other literary scholar. 	Asefwenyo ni ahero wacho weche ma ne Walibora owacho moloyo jondiko mamoko sama apuonjo Chik mar Nyithindo.
His contribution to jurisprudence cannot be gainsaid.	Walibora nokonyo ahinya e weche Chik.
As a lawyer, I draw inspiration from Walibora’s book Kufa Kuzikana, translated by Prof Egara Kabaji et al as “Friends for Life”.	"An okil, kendo ahero ahinya somo buk mane Walibora ondiko miluongo ni ""Kufa Kuzikana"" ma Profesa Egara Kabaji oloko ni ""Osiepe ma Ngita gi Del."""
In this text, a litigant who has made several trips to a lawyer’s office to claim money paid to the lawyer by an insurance company after an accident eventually commits suicide when the lawyer becomes uncooperative.	E bugno, iwuoyo kuom ng'at moro ma ne odere nikech ne odhi e ofis okil mondo omiye pesa mar insurance bang' yudo hinyruok to okil notamore.
The mastery of African idioms runs through his works. 	Bugene mang'eny opong' gi ngeche mag Jo-Afrika.
Such lawyers within the legal circles are known as ambulance chasers. They exist in every corner of this country; taking advantage of victims of accidents to mint millions of shillings. 	Okinde kaka mago iluongo ni joma lawo geche mating'o jotuo. Giyudore kamora amora e pinyni, kendo gihero tiyo gi thuolo moneno sama aksident otimore mondo giyudo pesa mang'eny.
My prayer is that the fate of Walibora’s characters will not befall him in death.	Lamona en ni tho Walibora kik ochal gi mag joma ondiko e bugene.
In such a society as ours, it calls for the courage and sobriety of men like Walibora to expose the social evils bedeviling mankind.	E kindewagi, dwaro ni ng'ato ni obed gi chir kaka Walibora mondo onyeny e lela gik maricho matimore.
The social pretense, political expediency and economic marginalisation are some of the things that informed Walibora’s works.	Moko kuom gik miwuoyoe e buge Walibora oriwo wuodruok ma ji nigo, wuondruok mag josiasa kod mibadhi e weche pesa.
The simplicity with which he told complex stories reveals the character of a man who was attached to society.	Nohera ahinya ji to mano nenore gi kaka nolero mayot sigendni mogajore.
The soils will consume the finest brains of our land.	Jomariek tho rumo.
Literature can be very predictive. Many things that Walibora wrote about have come to pass.	Seche moko buge nyalo koro gik madhi timore. Thoth gik ma Walibora nondiko osetimore.
His death and burial resemble that of the characters he wrote about. 	Thone kod kaka noyike chalo gi mag joma ne ondiko e bugene.
In William Shakespeare’s words, my heart is in that grave where Walibora’s remains are being preserved.	Katiyo weche ma William Shakespear nowacho, chunya nie bur kama okanie ringre Walibora.
Blessed are the soils of that quiet village in Cherangany, where Walibora was laid to rest. 	Lowo mane oyikie Walibora en gweng' mar Cherengany en kama oguedhi.
To your fans, we shall remain friends wa Kufa Kuzikana as we wait for that Siku Njema that we shall join you wherever you are! 	Ne johera mag Ken Walibora, wabiro siko ka wan osiepe ma Kufa Kuzikana ka warito Siku Njema ma wabiro romoe gi Walibora kendo.
May his soul rest in peace.	Mad chunye obed kama okuwe.
Hyrax Hills National Museum, one of Kenya’s critical archaeological sites and a national monument is marking 100 years of existence this month.	Hyrax Hills National Museum, ma oting'o gige machon mag Kenya, timo e dweni nyasi mar paro betie margi kuom higni 100.
The famous archaeological site which has since placed Kenya as home of Early Man opened its doors in 1920, to host rich history and has since inspired history and geography lessons in schools.	Kama ong'ereno moting'o gik machon miyo ikwano Kenya kaka kama dhano mokwongo ne okwongo dakie, ne oyaw e higa mar 1920 kendo osekonyo e puonjo histori kod jografi e skunde.
The museum was declared a national monument in 1945, but opened its doors to the public in 1965.	Museumno ne oland kaka mwandu sirkal e higa mar 1945, kata kamano ne oyiene ji chako donjoe e higa mar 1965.
“This month marks 100 years of existence of this archaeological site that is just another classroom for thousands of learners across the country who visit,” Lilian Amwada, the museum’s curator said.	"Lilian Amwanda, mochung' ne museumno, wacho kama, ""E dweni kae biro rwako higni 100 kendo osebedo kaka klas ne jopuonjre alufe e piny mabiroga limbe."""
And while the museum has been a source of knowledge on early humans, the number of visitors touring the site has been low, a move which has also seen a raft of initiatives in place to boost the numbers.	Kata obedo ni museumno osebedo ka konyo ji ng'eyo weche e wi joma chon, jok ma biro limbe kanyo kwan margi osebedo ka dok chien to mano osemiyo olos chenro moko mondo otem ywayo ji momedore obi olim kanyo.
“We have carried out renovations and also initiated talent programmes for children in a bid to make the young learners visit the museum more for key lessons,” Ms Amwada said.	"Amwanda nowacho kama, ""Waloso kuonde mokethore kendo wachako timo piem mag talent ne nyithindo mondo mano oywagi gibi gipuonjre weche momedore."""
Hyrax, is part of the part of the critical, geologically rich areas in Rift Valley that provides tales of  historical footprints left behind by Early Man. 	Hyrax en achiel kuom kuonde mayudore Rift Valley machiwo puonj e wi ngima dhano makwongo e histori.
It also boasts of a rich history of volcanic activities and information on the formation of the Rift Valley.	Oting'o bende histori ma nyalilanda e wi gik mane otimore e gode man kuno kod kaka Rift Valley ne olosore.
The site, is also part of patches of archaeological sites that makes Kenya and especially the Rift Valley a hotbed of archaeological discoveries alongside Kariandusi Archeological site in Gilgil.	Hyrax en achiel kuom kuonde mang'eny moting'o gige machon mamiyo Kenya to ahinya ahinya Rift Valley kod Kariandusi, Gilgil bedo kuonde moting'o weche mathoth e ngima machon.
Particularly, Hyrax hills museum is named after hyraxes that lived in the rocks within and is famous for keeping the history of Sirikwa people who are believed to have been assimilated with the Maasai community.	Museum mantie Hyrax hills ne omi nyingno bang' gik miluongo ni hyrax ma ne odak e kite madongo kendo kanyo ong'ere nikech oting'o histori mar Jo-Sirikwa ma wachore ni ne olokore mobedo Maasai.
The museum, has since been an archaeological research area and reference point for pre-historical investigations.	Jogo ma dwaro timo nonro e wi gik mane otimore chon ahinya e ngima dhano dhiga e museumno.
It is also believed to be the first Acheulian site to be discovered in the region.	Wachore bende ni kanyo ema nokwong yudie gik ma dhano mokwongo ne tiyogo e loso gik moko.
Records from the museum however reveal low visitation despite the critical role in education sector with the bulk of visitors being learners.	Rekod mag museumno nyiso ni kwan mag welo ma limo kanyo tin kata obedo ni migawo mar somo temo matek mondo ong'ere kendo joma dhiga kanyo thothgi gin jopuonjre.
In 2016, Hyrax Hills National Museum recorded 21,781 visitors of whom 17,667 were learners from primary, secondary and institutions of higher learning.	E higa mar 2016,  Hyrax Hills National Museum nowacho ni ne giyudo welo maromo 21,781 to ji 17,667 kuomgi ne gin jopuonjre mag skund primary, sekondar kod kuonde somo mamalo.
In 2018, the museum generated Sh1.6 million while in 2019, total revenues amounted Sh1.7 million.	E higa mar 2018, museumno ne oyudo pesa maromo siling milion 1.6 to e higa mar 2019, ne pesa duto ma gin go ne en siling milion 1.7.
The same year, the museum generated Sh1.8 million and the following year, the revenues dropped slightly to Sh1.6 million with over 23,000 visitors making to the museum.	E higa achielno, museum noyudo milion 1.8 to e higa ma ne oluwo, pesa manochok nodok chien nyaka milion 1.6 ka welo ma ne olimo museum kwan margi ne okalo 23,000.
Primary and secondary school learners mostly visit the museum with records showing that 12,169 learners from primary and secondary school visited the museum.	Jo primary kod jopuonjre sekondary ema thothne limo museum rekod nyiso ni kwan mar jopuonjrego ne ochopo 12,169.
5,498 students from colleges and universities visited the museum the same year.	 E higano bende, jopuonjre mag kolej kod yunivasiti ma ne olimo museumno kwan margi ne ochopo 5,498.
Locals visiting the museum are mostly couples visiting for nature trails. 	Jo-Kenya mamoko ma limo museumno thothgi gin jomokendore ma obiro bayo.
With charges as low as Sh100 for an adult local citizen and Sh50 for a child charged in these sites, locals still miss out with visitors barely making to 30,000 in a year.  	Pesa midonjogo tin nikech jomadongo chulo siling 100 to nyithindo chulo 50, to ema pod Jo-Kenya mang'eny ok bi ka kwan-gi tekga mondo ochop ji 30,000 e higa.
The Hyrax hills was proclaimed a national monument in 1945 and opened to public in 1965 but despite the significance it has, it has lost two and a half acres of its over 50 acres of land to squatters. 	Hyrax hills ne oland kaka mwandu sirkal e higa mar 1945, kata kamano ne oyiene ji chako donjoe e higa mar 1965, to kata obedo ni en kaka lich kamano, oselalo lowo maromo eka ariyo gi nus ne jodak kuom eka 50 ma en go.
According to the National Lands Commission Nakuru County coordinator Frank Kimbelekenya, part of the land has been grabbed.	Ka luwore gi Frank Kimbelekenya ma en jachan bura mar National Lands Commission e kaonti mar Nakuru, ne owacho ni jodak okawo gi thuon lop museum.
Covid-19 has given a new lease of life to an old song about social distancing.	Covid-19 ochiero wer moro machon ma ne wuoyo e bedo mabor gi wadu.
Micah Maritim (pictured) the singer who composed the song 18 years ago, is also basking in new-found glory.	Micah Maritim (monyis e picha) e jawer mane ondiko werno higni 18 mokalo kendo sani humbe landore.
In the 10-minute song, Maritim warns about a certain incurable disease, urging his listeners to literally run to the hills for safety. 	E wer makawo dakika aparno, Maritim chiwo siem e wi tuo moro ma onge yadhe, kendo ojiwo jowinjo mondo oring odhi e gode giyud resruok.
“Don’t let anyone touch you/ even when you are in bed sleeping/ Don’t brush shoulders with anyone even when you are walking around/ Don’t shake hands with anyone; and why should you? do you know that the person has come from or touched....?” Goes part of the chorus. 	"Bath koras mar wendno wacho kama, ""Kik iwe nga'to omuli/ kata sama inindo e otanda; Kik ituomri gi ng'ato ang'ata sama iwuotho; Kik imos lwet ng'ato; ang'o momiyo idwa mose? Be ing'eyo kama ng'atno oaye kota omulo…?"""
The 62-year-old singer from Bomet County is known for his social commentary.	Jawerno ma sani jahigni 62 kendo owuok e kaonti mar Bomet bende ong'ere gi weche mojawachoga.
He said he composed the uncharacteristically lengthy song in 2002. 	Owacho ni ondiko wer ma rarieyano e higa mar 2002.
“At the time, I was in Eldoret and television channels were awash with reports of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which had broken out in China and was spreading to other countries,” Maritim said.	"Maritim wacho kama, ""E kindeno, nadak Eldoret kendo nilando e tv ripode mag tuo miluongo ni Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) mane omouch China kendo landore e pinje mamoko."""
“From the scary news clip I saw medics in protective gear attending to patients, and outside, police officers were chasing people off the streets. It was then that I decided to compose a song about this phenomenon.”	"Odhi nyime wacho kama, ""Pichni ma ne anenogo ne nyalo bwogo ng'ato kendo naneno laktech kobawore gi lewni moumo dendgi duto sama githietho jotuo, to polise ne riembo ji odog e utegi. Mano e ma nomiyo andiko wendno."""
He says that he did not even sit down to write lyrics to the song titled “SARS”.	"Owacho ni ne ok obet piny mondo ondik weche wer miluongo ni ""SARS""."
Maritim started singing in 1981 and has a repertoire of over 100. 	Maritim ne ochako wer e higa mar 1981 kendo osewero wende mokalo 100.
He says he just entered the studio and “went with the flow”. 	"Owacho ni nodojo e studio to ochako mana wero ""gima obiro e pache."""
“What scared me was China’s directive outlawing spitting. I dreaded what would happen in Kenya if SARS got here, considering that members of the Kalenjin community have a habit of spitting all over the place,” Maritim said. 	"Maritim medo wacho kama, ""Gima nomiya luoro en chik mane China ogolo makwero ng'udho olap. Naluor ahinya kane aparo gima biro timore ka SARS ochopo Kenya, nikech thoth Jo-Kalenjin nigi tim mar ng'udho olaw kamoro amora."""
Though the song got considerable airtime, Maritim says he is surprised by the renewed interest in the song in the face of Covid-19. 	Kata obedo ni e kinde ma ne ogol werno thoth ji ne owinje e redio, Maritim wacho ni owuoro ahinya ni ji odok e winjo werno nikech Covid-19.
The singer blasted Kenyans for disregarding the government directives on containment of Covid-19. 	Jawerno ne noseyo Jo-Kenya ma tamore luwo chike ma sirkal chiwo mondo ogeng' landruok mar Covid-19.
“The world managed to beat SARS and Ebola by adhering to prescribed safety measures. Here, we are just dancing with death,” he said. 	"Nowacho kama, ""SARS kod Ebola ne orumo nikech ji noluwo chike ma ne oketnegi. Wan watugo gi tho."""
When asked whether he was living up to his own message of staying safe as per his message in the song, he said: “My brother, have you spotted me in the streets lately? I have confined myself to my house as a matter of fact.” 	"Ka ne openje ka be oluwo paro ma ne ochiwo e wer mane owero, nowacho kama, ""Osiepa, be iseroma koda kawuotho oko machiegnini? Alorora e oda."""
Maritim argued that according to him there is no difference between SARS and Covid-19. 	Maritim wacho ni en oneno ni onge pogruok e kind SARS kod Covid-19.
“It is the same disease, just diffident names. You just look at the symptoms and the origins and it’s the same thing.	"Owacho niya, ""En tuo achiel, nying ema opogore. Tem ane rango ranyisi mag tuogo kod kaka ne gichakore, ibiro yudo ni gin gimoro achiel."
“During SARS people were advised to practice social distancing and those infected were quarantined.	E kinde tuo mar SARS, ne onyis ji mondo kik gibed machiegni gi jowetegi to jotuo ne iketo tenge.
“We were also told to wash our hands and cover our mouths while coughing. Aren’t we now being told the same things?” he said. 	Ne onyiswa bende mondo walog lwetewa kendo waum dhowa sama wafwolo. Donge mago e gik mwatimo sani?
The only difference he said is that people are now being asked to wear gloves for protection. 	"Pogruok mantie en ni sani ji umo nyaka lwetegi."""
Maritim said since Covid-19 knocked the dust off his song, someone who was listening to it for the first time accused him of “bringing” the disease to Kenya. 	"Maritim nowacho nikech Covid-19 ne omiye wende ong'ere kendo, ng'at moro ma yande kowinjo wendno mokwongo ne owacho ni en ema ""okelo"" tuono Kenya."
“I did not ‘call’ the disease. I have never travelled to China. I just did a song to educate them to practice social distancing whenever the world is ravaged by a disease whose cure is not known,” he said, and called on Kenyans to heed the government’s directive on social distancing. 	"Nojiwo ji mondo oluw chike mar sirkal oketo kendo nowacho niya, ""Ne ok akelo tuono. Pok adhiga kata China. Nawero wendno mondo ojiw ji obed mabor gi jowetegi sama tuo moro omuoch e piny ma yadhe ok ong'ere."""
“If the government directs that there should be no handshaking, why should we defy such a simple order? Can’t we just salute like military officers and everyone goes his or her way. Why do we want to kill each other with foolishness?” he posed.	"Nopenjo kama: ""Ka sirkal owacho ni ji kik mosre, ang'o momiyo watamore luwo gima yot kamano? Donge wanyalo mana goyo salut kaka askeche timoga kae to wadhi kama wadhiye? Ang'o momiyo wadwaro nego jowetewa nikech fupwa?"""
The mark of a great book is often its ability to provoke robust debates and force readers to confront uncomfortable content.	Buk maber ing'eyo gi kaka ji wuoyo e weche manie bugno kendo chuno jasomo mondo osome kata ka ok odwar.
Kenyan, Christian, Queer by the academic Adriaan Van Klinken provides a way to imagine a future continent where members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community can exercise their rights to dignity, voice, agency, space and health without fear of stigma, harassment and worse.	Buk milungo ni Kenyan, Christian, Queer mondik gi Adriaan Van Klinken wuoyo e wi ndalo ma piny biro pong' gi mon makendo jowetegi, kod chwo makendore gi chwo wetegi  to ji yanygi kata kwedogi kendo gin gi ratiro mar chiwo pachgi, timo ohala kod yudo thieth ma ok obuon-gi.
The author is a leading voice in LGBTI studies, with a special focus on the role of religion, in particular African Christianity.	Jandikono ong'ere ahinya e kedo ne ratiro kod somo mag LGBTI, ka onono ahinya ahinya migawo ma din omako e wechego, to ahinya din mar Jokristo ma Afrika.
In Kenyan, Christian, Queer he presents an ethnographic study of the Kenyan queer community, one that is creating space for its own church and queer theology in a homophobic social, religious and political environment.	E buk mar Kenyan, Christian, Queer owuoyo e wi kwan mag chwo ma kendore gi chwo, kod mon makendore gi mon e piny Kenya kod kaka gin gi kanisa margi kod puonjgi e alwora ma ji obuonogie e yore duto moriwo din kod siasa.
Van Klinken wades into a controversial subject to document an array of queer creative practices. In doing so, he advances LGBTI studies.	Van Klinken wuoyo e wich ma ji nigi paro mopogore ahinya kendo odwaro ndiko wechego. Kuom timo kamano, omedo nonro e somo mag LGBTI.
This eloquently written book bravely pushes boundaries.	Bugno nyiso maonge luoro moro amora kaka ji onego we buono jogo.
It is remarkable in style and clarity but also brings out the author’s own vulnerabilities, strengths and compassion as an HIV positive gay scholar and activist.	Ondik bugno e yo mawinjore maler ahinya kata kamano, olero bende nyawo moko ma jandikono nigo kod gik moberie nikech jandiko nigi tuo mar ayaki kendo okedo ne ratiro mar chwo ma kendore gi chwo wetegi.
I have known and worked with him for a long time, and this book marks a shift from abstract and academic writing to a creative documentary about the very personal lives of real people. It straddles the gap between academia and LGBTI activism.	Ang'eyo jandikono kendo asetiyo kode kuom ndalo malach, to bugni opogore gi buge mamoko ma oting'oga mana rieko mag skul kar mano en to owuyo e wi ngima joma nitie adier. Onyiso pogruok mantie wi somo mapile kod somo mar LGBTI.
The book is also a departure from despair and crippling homophobia.	Bugno bende golo luoro ma ji nigago e wi LGBTI.
It records the experiences of people who refuse to be hopeless victims: people with hope and urgency, who navigate between resistance and human flourishing, creating more space for community and affirmation. 	Bugno oting'o sigand joma ok dwar dak e mudho, ma gin joma nigi geno kendo kata obedo ni ikwedogi, ging'eyo ni ginyalo dak maber to mano kelo dongruok.
It allows its subjects to tell their own stories.	Bugno chiwo thuolo mondo ji owach sigandgi giwegi.
The book examines four cases: activism through art, such as the works of the late Binyavanga Wainaina; music by the gay gospel artiste George Barasa; the Stories of Our Lives anthology of short films; and the Cosmopolitan Affirming Church in Nairobi.	Bugno wuoyo e gik moko ang'wen: kedo ne ratiro kokalo kuom wende, buge kod gik migoro, kaka mondik gi Binyavanga Wainaina; wende mondik gi George Barasa; sinembe machieko chieko miluongo ni Stories of Our Lives; Kanisa moro mantie Nairobi.
In each of these, the author shows how LGBTI actors have reclaimed visibility and engaged Christian beliefs, texts and symbols.	E moro kamoro kuom wechego, jandiko nyiso kaka jo LGBTI osemedo ng'ere kendo gimakore gi puonj Jokristo kod buge.
The use of case studies allows for rich and in-depth examinations of the ways in which the LGBTI community in Nairobi is reclaiming social, political, cultural, spiritual and artistic spaces.	Tiyo gi ranyisi mosetimore e ngima ji konyo mondo ji one kaka jokanyo mag LGBTI mantie Nairobi omako kamaduong' e ngima ji, siasa kod din.
Wainaina took on Christian clergy and homophobes, calling them out for their hypocrisy, in particular Pentecostal Christianity.	Wainaina nowuoyo kuom wuondruok ma jotend kanisa nigo kod kaka gibuono ji, ahinya ahinya jo Pentecostal Christianity.
He made this a personal struggle in which he came out as gay and used his body as a site for resistance, vulnerability, acceptance and rejection.	Nowuoyo kuom ngimane owuon kane owacho ni ohero chwo wetene kende ne oyie mondo ji obwone kendo okwede.
His activism gave impetus to the LGBTI community in Kenya and further afield and his death continued to provoke debates about LGBTI issues.	Ranyisi mare nojiwo joma nie riwruok mara LGBTI Kenya kendo tho mare ne omiyo ji odhi nyime wuoyo e wi LGBTI.
The video of the song Same Love (Remix) by Art Attack caused huge excitement in the Kenyan artistic and social scene.	Vidio mar wer miluongo ni Same Love (Remix) mower gi Art Attack nomiyo Jo-Kenya manyeny ma jower owuoyo.
The song is about LGBTI struggles, gender equality and civil liberties.	Wendno wuoyo e wi chandruoge ma LGBTI romogo kendo owuoyo e chiwo ratiro marom ne ji te.
Yet the song serves as a space for political and theological activism. 	To ema pod jodin kod josiasa kwedo werno.
It serves as a beautiful cultural expression of African queer politics – and was promptly banned by Kenya’s Film Control Board.	Wendno nyiso paro ma Jo-Afrika nigo e wi mon mohero mon kod chwo mohero chwo kendo nogo wendo marfuk gi Kenya Film Control Board.
The song crossed social, theological and cultural boundaries and focused attention on the theology of radical and non-normative love.	Wendno nokalo kiewo mag chike oganda kod puonj kanisa kendo wendno ne jiwo hera ma ok ber.
Rap music has long been used as a space for protest and activism.	Wende miluongo ni rap ema kinde mang'eny itiyogo kikwedo kata ng'anjo ne gimoro.
Stories of Our Lives by the Nest, a Nairobi-based arts collective, is a collection of personal stories based on interviews with ordinary gay people.	Sinema miluongo ni 'Stories of Our Lives' molos gi Nest ma en grup moro mantie Nairobi, oting'o sigand ji mopogore opogore ma gin joma diher kendore gi chwo wetegi.
Like Same Love, it was promptly banned by the film board, a body that has frequently frustrated Kenya’s creativity in the guise of protecting the nation’s moral fabric.	Mana kaka wer mar 'Same Love', en be ne ogoye marfuk gi film board,ma en bura ma osegawang'o I Jokenya nyading'eny gi timgi mar wuondruok ni girito timbe maler e piny.
The more the film is banned, the more it is downloaded.	Kaka imedo go vidiono marfuk e kaka ji mang'eny medo manye.
It addresses themes such as identity, love, sex, faith and spirituality, stories that capture the diversity of contemporary Kenyan queer lives and their day-to-day experiences.	Vidiono wuoyo e wi weche kaka fwenyruok, hera, nindruok, yie kod din ma gin weche momako Jo-Kenya manie LGBTI.
Personal stories are not just authentic, they are also empowering and affirming. They give voice and impetus to communities in struggle.	Sama ng'ato lero gima otimore e ngimane owuon, mano jiwo jomoko kendo ji nyalo bedo gadier gi wechego. Gikonyo e lando pek ma ji romogo.
The last case study is that of the Cosmopolitan Affirming Church, a social and spiritual space where members of the LGBTI community can practise their faith in community with each other.	Wach mogik minono en kanisa miluongo ni Cosmopolitan Affirming Church, ma orkwo ji duto kendo kanyo ero jo LGBTI nyalo bedo thuolo gi jowetegi.
It is a safe space to create gay and radical theologies; a space for acceptance and love. 	En kama inyalo riwo joma nindore gi chwo kata mon wetegi kod puonj din, kama orwakie ji duto kendo hera nitie.
It is a space where faith and radical love and sexuality meet.	Mano en kama yie kod hera ma ok pile kod joma kit nindrukgi opogore romoe.
Van Klinken identifies with the struggles of his research subjects but was able to maintain some distance when writing about them.	Kata obedo ni weche ma Van Klinken ondiko chalre gi matimore e ngimane, ne owuye kuome owuon.
This is the kind of book I will read again and again as a straight, Christian, female academic and commentator.	Ma en buk mabiro somo nyanding'eny kata obedo ni an to an nyako ma jakristo mohero yawuoyi kendo ohero ndiko.
I will happily share it not just with my students and library but also with those who would like to better understand these contested lives and spaces.	Abiro nyiso jopuonjrena bugni kendo kete e laibrari mara, bende daher nyiso jogo madwaro ng'eyo joma ngimagi opogore gi mekwa.
Many spiritual leaders need to read it to understand that LGBTI communities are creating their own spaces of worship where they find love and acceptance of their humanity as children of God.	Jotend din onego osom bugni mondo ging'e ni LGBTI loso giwegi kama ginyalo leme ma ji biro rwakogi kendo herogi kaka nyithi Nyasaye.
This book evokes many feelings but also forces one to confront one’s own uninformed biases.	Bugni chiero paro mang'eny kuom ng'ato moriwo nyaka chuny mar buono ma ng'ato ne ok par ni en-go
It’s a good read for those who often shout the loudest, without sufficient understanding of LGBTI lives.	Joma paroga ni ong'eyo LGBTI onego osom bugni mondo kik giwach gik ma ok ging'eyo.
Mike Rua (pictured), the self-proclaimed king of Mugithi, says he lives for the vulgar.	Mike Rua (Monyis e picha), ma luongore ni ruodh Mugithi, wacho ni ohero weche mochido.
Rua, who has built his popularity in the music industry by spitting lyrics that raise more than eyebrows on stage, says he cannot change his style of music.	Rua mong'ere nikech oweroga wende mochido wacho ni ok onyalo loko yo mowergo.
He says his attempt to tone down has seen him clash with his fans.	Owacho ni joherane ok dwar ni otim lokruok e thumbe.
He now says he will take it a notch higher and his new composition will be even more lewd.	Owacho ni odwa goyo okang' momedore kendo wende moloso manyien oting'o weche maricho ahinya.
He recalls how in 2012, during a music tour in Dubai, police were called on him on allegations that he was impersonating Mike Rua.	Oparo kaka e higa mar 2012, ka ne odhi wer Dubai, noluongne polise nikech ne wachore ni owuondore ni en Mike Rua.
After a two-hour performance at an event attended by hundreds of Kenyans in the diaspora, Rua was accosted by the police.	Bang' wer kuom seche ariyo e nyasi moro ma ne oting'o Jo-Kenya modak loka, polis ne omako Rua.
A fan had complained that the man who performed was not Rua.	Nitie ng'ama nochiwo ripot ni ng'ar maweno ok en Rua.
Police told him that the Rua the fans knew and the Rua who had performed that night were two different people. 	Polis nonyise ni Rua ma ji ong'eyo gi Rua ma ne ower otienono ne gin ji ariyo mopogore.
They felt they had not received a good dose of his music after he decided to tone down his wordings.	Ne giwacho ni ne ok ower mamit nikech ne ok otiyo gi weche mochido.
The same message has been told by his fans in Nairobi who have asked him to go back to the original Rua – the man who spits venom on stage. 	Mano be e gima joherane man Nairobi osenyise ni olokre obed Rua machon ma ne wacho weche makech ka sum sama ower.
The Kikuyu benga artiste is, however, bidding good bye to performing songs composed by other musicians.	Jathum ma benga ma Ja-Kikuyuno wacho ni odwa weyo wero wende mondik jothum mamoko.
“This is what my fans want. I have to give them what they demand for otherwise I will be out of business,” he says.	"Owacho kama, ""Ma e gima joma ohero wendega dwaro. Nyaka atim kaka gidwaro nono to ohanda biro podho."""
He says he has in the past found himself brushing shoulders with the police over copyright infringement.	Owacho ni e kinde mokalo, polise osemake nyading'eny ni okwalo wende jomoko.
Rua has risen to fame by remixing compositions by other musicians, which he twists to make almost a new composition.	Rua nobedo gi huma nikech ondikoga manyien wende jothum moko kae to ogwenyogi giwuog ka wer manyien.
He says remixing will now be a thing of the past.	Owacho ni koro oweyo tiyo gi wende jomoko.
He has hit the studio to record new songs, including one titled Kiarie, which is already out.	Owacho ni ne osedhi e studio mowero wende manyien ma achiel kuomgi iluongo ni Kiarie ma sani yudore.
And true to his spirit and motto, he has spiced up the new album with a tinge of vulgarities.	To mana kaka nosingore ni obiro timo, wer manyienno opong' gi weche mochido.
In an interview with the Saturday Standard at his Syokimau home, Rua says media houses had at first almost shunned the composition on the basis that it was lewd.	Rua nonyiso oboke mar Saturday Standard, ka en dalane Syokimau, nowacho ni ute fwambo notamore kawo wer mare nikech oting'o weche molil.
But things changed when the album, which is complete with a video, became a hit on social media and is now popularly played in many vernacular FM radio stations.	Kata kamano, weche nolokore kane otieko loso albam ma nigi vidio kendo ji mang'eny nohere e social media kendo oket wendego e stesen mag redio mang'eny.
Rua says ‘Kiarie’, which in Kikuyu means wide, is based on his real life experience.	Rua wacho ni 'Kiarie', ma e dho Kikuyu mano tiende gima lach, wuoyo kuom gik mosekaloe e ngimane.
It is the story of a young man, struggling to make it in life and ends up cohabiting with a sugar mummy.	En sigand dichwo moro ma pod tin, ma nyagore gi ngima to gikone odak gi miyo moro ma ochot.
And the sugar mummy at times confuses him (Rua) with Kiarie.	Miyo ma ochotno seche moko paro ni Rua en Kiarie.
But this is not all about the song as is expected of Rua.	To mano ok e wach kende ma wer losoe mana kaka Rua.
He tantalises the composition with a hidden message of his love life to the sugar mummy and there in fits the hidden message of ‘Kiarie’.	Owacho ni nitie gimopondo mitemo ler ei wendno ma en hera moherogo miyono mano ema omiyo iluonge ni 'Kiarie'.
The composition leaves it to the listener to decode which ‘Kiarie’ he is referring to.	Yo mondikgo werno mondo jawinjo ema yiero ni en 'Kiarie' mane ma iwuoyo kuome.
Apart from Rua, other upcoming Kikuyu musicians such as Samuel Ndirangu, alias Samido, are giving the veterans a run for their money.	Mopogore gi Rua, jothum moko mag Kikuyu ma nyocha eka ochako wer gin Samuel Ndirangu, mong'ere kaka Samido piem matek gi jower machon.
Samido is famed for his songs Wendo wi Cama (love is sweet) and Murata wa Ngai (Friend of God), which have been topping the FM airwaves. 	Samido ong'ere nikech wendege kaka Wendo wi Cama (hera mit) kod Murata wa Ngai (Osiep Nyasaye) ma ojagaket e redio.
He did Wendo wi Cama together with Joys wa Mama.	Ne owero Wendo wi Cama kaachiel gi Joys wa Mama.
Jose Gatutura is another sensation.	Jose Gaturura be en jawer machielo ma ji ohero.
The musical star of the Machete hit maker has been rising with every new release.	Ne owero wer ma ji mang'eny ong'eyo miluongo ni Machete kendo humbe medo landore gi wer ka wer mogolo manyien.
Among his prominent songs are Tuirio twega (good food), Mwari wa Muthamaki (Daughter of a king) and Haha ni Gute (this is vanity).	Moko kuom wendege mong'ere ahinya gin Tuirio twega (chiemo maber), Mwari wa Muthamaki (Nyar ruoth) kod Haha ni Gute (ma gima kayiem).
USIU-Africa and Kenya Film Commission (KFC) have signed a five-year agreement to boost film studies.	USIU-Africa kod Kenya Film Commission (KFC) odonjo e winjruok machielo mar higni abich mondo gisir somo mag loso sinema.
The Memorandum of Understanding is aimed at making Kenya a first-class provider of screen entertainment for local, regional and international markets.	Gima iluongo ni Memorandum of Understanding dhi konyo e miyo Kenya obed namba achiel e loso vidio mamoro Jo-Kenya, pinje molworowa kod pinje maoko.
To this end the university commits to provide quality and relevant training.	Nikech mano, yunivasiti ong'ado ni gibiro chiwo tiegruok mong'ith kendo mowinjore.
In the agreement, the two institutions will work together to build capacity through organising film classes, workshops, seminars, film boot camps, short courses, projects and programmes.	E winjruok ma ne otimno, kuonde tiegruok ariyogo biro tiyo kanyachiel e loso gima ber kokalo kuom bedo gi klas mipuonjoe ji loso sinema, romo ma tiegruok, semina, loso kembe mag puonj, klese machieko chieko, chiwo tije kod programbe.
The two institutions will also market the Kalasha International Film and TV Festivals to increase market penetration and visibility for Kenyan content at international film markets.	Kuonde tiegruok ariyogo biro lando ote mar Kalasha International Film and TV Festivals mondo ji mang'eny ong'e kendo sinembe mag Kenya one e pinje maoko.
USIU-Africa Vice Chancellor Paul Zeleza said the partnership will position both institutions as resource centres for local broadcasters, media, film and communication researchers and scholars as USIU-Africa will be able to offer mentorship programmes for students interested in film.	Vice chancellor mar USIU-Africa, Paul Zeleza, nowacho ni winjruok ma gitimono biro miyo kuonde tiegruokgo obed kama inyalo kawie joma itiyogo e ute fwambo gi keyo kaachiel kod joma timo nonro nikech USIU-Africa biro konyo jopuonjre madwaro ng'eyo kaka iloso sinema.
“We will conduct film industry research and collect data, which will enable us to develop short courses tailor-made for industry practitioners for certification,” said Prof Zeleza.	"Profesa Zeleza nowacho kama, ""Wadhi timo nonro e wi sinembe kendo choko weche mabiro konyowa loso klese moko machieko ne joma puonjore loso sinema kae to wamiyogi satifiket."""
Kenya Film Commission Chief Executive Officer Timothy Owase said the State corporation will continue to source and negotiate for tax relief incentives on film and animation equipment to boost the industry growth.	Timothy Owase ma en CEO mar Kenya Film Commission, nowacho ni gibiro dhi nyime kwayo mondo odwoknegi osuru michulo e nyiewo masinde mitiyogo e loso sinema to mano biro konyogi timo dongruok.
“We will offer guidance on standards of excellence and advocate for the use of best practice in film production while working closely with relevant government agencies to create robust and streamlined mid-level film education that will lead to more exportation of locally-made films,” sais Owase.	"Owase nowacho kama, ""Wabiro chiwo weche matayo rang'iny monego bedie kendo wabiro ji mondo otem giti tich maber e loso sinema ka watiyo machiegni gi ofise mowinjore mag sirkal  e chiwo puonj makare mabiro miyo sinembe miloso onyis nyaka e pinje maoko."""
Today, many people, especially Africans find it hard to identify with their cultural values and way of life as a result of embrace to modernisation and civilisation.	E kindewagi, ji mang'eny ahinya ahinya Jo Afrika, yudo ka teknegi makore gi kit ngima mar ogandagi kendo gihero timo kendo luwa kit ngima ma nyasani.
One man in Elgeyo Marakwet has taken it upon himself to preserve the fading culture of the Keiyo community, which is part of the Kalenjin subtribes.	Dichwo moro man Elgeyo Marakwet okawo okang' mar neno ni kit ngima Jo-Keiyo ok olal, ma en achiel kuom dhoudi mag Kalenjin.
Joseph Kwambai, 70, said modernisation has changed the African society from a traditional socio-economic setup to where locals have now adapted to new norms and way of life.	Joseph Kwambai ma jahigni 70, wacho ni kit ngima ma nya sani oseloko pach Jo-Afrika ma giweyo dak kaka chon kendo sani giluwo kit ngima ma ndaloni.
“Driven by the need to ensure future generations get a feeling of how Africans behaved and conducted themselves in the past, I have been collecting Keiyo relics and preserving them in a museum in Chekobei village in Keiyo south sub county for the past 20 years,” said Mr Kwambai.	"Kwambai nowacho kama, ""Daher ni tieng' mabiro ong'e kaka kit ngima Jo-Afrika ne chalo kod kaka ne gitimo gik moko, omiyo asebedo ka achoko gik machon mag Jo-Keiyo kendo kanogi e museum mantie Chekobei ei Keiyo South Sub-county kuom higni 20."""
Situated next to Chekobei Primary, along the Iten-Kabarnet road, the cultural centre is decked with a collection of books showing how the cultural heritages of African communities used to live and socialize in the past.	Museumno yudore machiegni gi Chekobei Primary e ndara mar Iten-Kabarnet, kendo opong' gi buge mawuoyo e wi kaka ogendni mopogore opogore mag Afrika nodak e kinde machon.

“I have several Biographies including the one of the late second President Daniel Arap Moi “the making of an African Statesman” by Andrew Morton and many others.

Books written by colonialists are also available,” he said.	"An bende gi buge mogo gi wasungu ma ne omonjo Afrika."""
Apart from the books at the Museum, other items showcased include those used in war, ceremonies, rituals, kitchen-ware and farming among others.	Mopogore gi buge, gik mamoko ma be inyiso e Museum kanyo gin gik machon ma ne otigo e lweny, nyasi, lamo, gik jokon, gige pur kod mamoko.

There is also a Keiyo homestead erected to illustrate how a family shared the rooms. 	Nitie ot molos mar Jo Keiyo manyiso kaka joot machon ne odak.
The old man was forced to travel wide and far in search of the traditional item.	Jaduong'no osewuotho kuonde maboyo komanyo gik machon-go.
“I am still collecting the items and part of history that I come across about different cultures more so the Keiyo community. Other communities should take up the initiative and ensure they preserve their cultures as a way of ensuring the coming generations will not be enslaved by the coming up of modernisation,” he opined.	"Owacho kama, ""Pod adhi nyime choko gik machon kod gige histori malero kit ngima dhoudi mopogore opogore to ahinya ma Jo Keiyo.

The centre was then commissioned in 2006 but officially opened four years later to the public.	Ne olos museumno e higa mar 2006, kata kamano, ne oyawe e higni ang'wen bang'e.
George Otieno’s passion for art started way back in 1988, on his first day in a primary school in Busia County, while staying with his maternal grandmother.	George Otieno nochako hero goro e higa mar 1988 e odiechienge mokwongo e skund primari e kaonti mar Busia, ndalo ma ne odak gi dagi.
“The first assignment in Standard One for us was to draw a vehicle. I drew a pickup, which the teacher liked and gave me a red tick. Since then, I knew any good thing should have a red tick. That is when I knew drawing is good,” said Otieno.	"Otieno wacho kama, ""Ka ne ane klas achiel, gima ne okwong nyiswa ni watim ne en goro mtoka. Ne agoro gach pikap, ma japuonj nochuoyona tik makwar. Chakre kindeno, ne ang'eyo ni gimoro amora maber onego obed gi tik makwar. Mano e ndalo mane afwenyoe ni goro mit."""
In Class Five, he started using coloured pencil. 	Ka ne ochopo e klas abich, ne ochako goro kotiyo gi kalas.
Later, he moved to Nairobi and did some causal jobs in the city’s Industrial Area as a causal labourer, though he never stopped painting, albeit for fun.	Bang'e ne odhi Nairobi kendo notiyo tije matindo tindo e Industrial Area, kata kamano, ne ok oweyo goro nikech nohero ahinya timo kamano.
“In the year 2007 I received Sh3,000 for a paint I did for then Health Minister Charity Ngilu and Sh7,000 from a former Kenya Dairy Board managing director. I then knew art pays,” said Otieno at his art studio in Milimani Court in Obama Estate, Nairobi.	"Otieno ma sani nigi studio mare e Milimani Court e Obama Estate, Nairobi, wacho kama: ""E higa mar 2007, ne ochula siling 3,000 kane agoro Charity Ngilu ma ne ochung' ne Migawo mar Thieth ndalono, kendo nayudo siling 7,000 ka ne agoro dairekta machon mar Kenya Dairy Board.

He quit the casual job, used the Sh30,000 he received after painting a picture of former President Daniel Moi to buy drawing equipment.	Ne oweyo tich ma ne otiyo kae to otiyo gi siling 30,000 mane omiye kogoro Ker machon Daniel Moi e ng'iewo gige goro.
He then set up a small workshop and ventured into commercial art.	Kae to noyawo nyaduka moro matin mane ousoe gik mogoro.
In 2002 when President Uhuru Kenyatta was running for presidency, Otieno saw a picture of former President Moi published in The Standard wearing a red kitenge shirt decorated with Kenya African National Union (Kanu) colours and a cockerel. 	E higa mar 2002, kane Ker Uhuru Kenyatta dwaro bedo ker, Otieno ne oneno picha mar ker machon Moi koket e The Standard korwako kitenge makwar ma nigi rangi mag KANU kod gweno.
“I drew Mzee Moi and besides him put President Kenyatta. I then drew Kanu flag and wrote, “Kanu Yajenga Nchi”.	"Otieno wacho ni ""Ne agoro Mzee Moi kae to e bathe agoro Ker Kenyatta. Nagoro bendech KANU kae to andiko ni: ""Kanu Yajenga Nchi""."
"""A neighbour saw and liked it. He introduced me to a friend called Mutua, who worked with then Presidential Escort Unit. Mutua asked him to bring the painting so that he could see it,” said Otieno."	"Nitie jiranda ma ne oneno pichano mohere. Bang'e, ne otuda gi osiepne moro miluongo ni Mutua ma ndalono ne tiyo gi askeche makowoga gach ker. Mutua ne onyise mondo okel picha mogorno mondo one."""
They met and Mutua introduced him to a University of Nairobi lecturer Prof Geoffrey ole Maloiy, a close friend of the late Mzee Moi, who took the painting to the President.	Ne giromo kendo Mutua ne otude gi japuonj matiyo e Yunivasiti mar Nairobi Profesa Geoffrey Ole Maloiy, ma ne en osipe Mzee Moi. Ne okawo pichano momiyo Ker.
“Within two days, Mutua called me and said Moi liked it and had paid Sh30,000. That was the first good amount I received from art and it was like a jackpot. The joy that President Moi liked my work and paid for it inspired me a lot,” said Otieno, born in Seme, Kisumu County.	"Otieno dhi nyime lero niya, ""Bang' odiechienge ariyo, Mutua nogochona monyisa ni Moi nohero pichano kendo ochulo siling 30,000. Mano e pesa maber mane ahango yudo kuom goro.

He has also sold two paintings of former US President Barrack Obama to an art collector, which fetched him Sh500,000. 	Bende, ne ouso pichni moko ariyo mag Ker machon mar Amerka, Barrack Obama, ne ng'at moro mohero choko gik mogor kendo nochule siling 500,000.

He didn’t give details.	Ne ok ofulo nyinge.
“There are two pictures I painted of former President Mwai Kibaki on a wheelchair and another in his office. They cost Sh500,000 but I was never paid,” said Otieno.	"Otieno wacho kama, ""Nitie pichni ariyo ma ne agoro mag ker machon Mwai Kibaki ka en e wheelchair gi machielo ka en e ofis. Nengogi giduto en siling 500,000 to ne ok ochula."""

The Kanu chairman also applauded the Kenya Film Commission and Kalasha for a job well done. 	Jakomno mar KANU bende ne opwoyo Kenya Film Commission kod Kalasha kuom timo tich maber.
“We want the local film industry to set the trend and make upcoming and aspiring musicians feel like they want to be part of it in years to come. With this kind of event, Kenya could easily provide 90 per cent local content and not be boring,” said Gideon.	"Gideon ne owacho kama, ""Wadwaro ni joma loso sinembe Kenya obed namba achiel e kelo paro manyien kendo gjiw jower ma eka chako mondo obed gi siso mar riwore kodgi.

He said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration was committed to having the local film industry transform the country.	Nowacho ni sirkand Ker Uhuru Kenyatta tiyo matek mondo sinembe miloso Kenya olok piny.
“We want to come out with a blockbuster movie to be sold in Africa, China and the rest of the world. We also want to set up a task force to ensure that we transform the local film industry by building theatres in all the 47 counties with the support of my ministry, the Nairobi senator, the Government and the media to ensure we come out with the best in terms of movies,” said Mr Mucheru.

There was also a moment of silence to pay tribute to fallen heroes among them former Vitimbi and Vioja Mahakamani actor Charles Kimani alias Masaku, former Churchill comedian Emmanuel Makori popularly known as Ayeiya and Mombasa-based actress Maureen Wanza,popularly known as Sasha.

Writer King’ori Gachoka was 22 years old when he first met celebrated author Francis Imbuga.	Jandiko miluongo ni King'ori Gachoka ne jahigni 22 ka ne ohango romo gi jandiko mong'ere Francis Imbuga.
Things were so bad for the budding writer such that he could not afford a typewriter.	Weche ne dhi maber ne jandiko maa pinyno kendo ne ok nyal kata ng'iewo typewriter.
His script for a play had just been rejected by a local television station because it was handwritten, and he thought this could end his dream.	Nitie tugo ma ne ondiko motero e TV, kata kamano jogo notamore nikech ne nondiko gi lwete kendo noparo ni mano e giko lek mare.
At the time, Gachoka was a student at Kenyatta University where the late Prof Imbuga, then 47 years old, was his dean, in the Arts Department.	E kindeno, Gachoko ne en japuonjre e Kenyatta University kaman Profesa Imbuga ma ne jahigni 47 kindeno, ne en dean mare e Arts Department.
His frustrations led him to share the rejected piece with Imbuga with the aim of borrowing his typewriter.	Nopimone Imbuga chandruok ma ne en-go ka dwache en ni Imbuga okonye gi typewriter.
The professor was impressed with his work and allowed him to use his valuable Olympia Traveller DeLuxe portable typewriter.	Profesano ne omor ahinya gima nondiko mi oyiene mondo oti gi masin mare ma nengone tek miluongo ni Olympia Traveller DeLuxe portable typewritter.
Yesterday, Gachoka, who will soon turn 47, could not hold back his tears as he parted with the typewriter, the same one that kick-started his career as well as Imbuga’s.	Nyoro Gachoka, ma biro rwako higni 47 machiegni, ne oywako sama ne ochiwo typewriter ma ne en kachiel gi Imbuga ochakogo tich.
The typewriter will now be part of the exhibition of Imbuga’s literary works.	Typewriter-no koro biro bedo achiel kuom gik mitang'o kinyiso tije Imbuga.
“I took time to prepare myself because I knew it was not going to be an easy thing. So in July and August this year, I carried the typewriter to every meeting I attended and everywhere I went,” said Gachoka.	"Gachoka ne owacho kama, ""Ne akawo thuolo mondo aikra maber nikech ne ang'eyo ni ok odhi bedo mayot chiwo. Omiyo e dwe mar Julai kod Agost higani, ne ating'oga typewriter-no e romo duto kod kamoro amora ma ne adhiye."""
Gachoka, who spoke during the launch of the exhibition yesterday, reminisced the days when he was struggling. He also narrated how the professor surprised him when he returned the typewriter.	Gachoka ma ne owuoyo nyoro e nyasi mitang'o tije Imbuga, ne owacho ni oparo ndalo ma ne ochandore. Nowacho gima profesa notimone ka ne oduokone typewriter.
“It is yours now. I gave it to you,” said Imbuga to Gachoka’s amazement.	"Imbuga nonyise niya, ""Koro en mari. Amiyogo."" To mano kaka Gachoka ne omor."
The typing machine, though slow, is still in good working condition.	Kata obedo ni masin mar ndikono dhi mos, pod otiyo maber.
Gachoka’s first literary work, a novel titled Divided Life, which thrust him into the  literature field, was produced using the type writer.	Buk ma Gachoka nokwongo ndiko ne en sigana miluongo ni 'Divide Life' (Ngima Mopogore) ne omiyo ong'ere e kaka jandiko kendo bugno ne olos gi typewriter.
The novel saw him brush shoulders with big names in the industry such as Prof Egara Kabaji, who was present during the launch of the exhibition.	Bugno nomiyo otudre gi ji ma nigi huma tij ndiko kaka Profesa Egara Kabaji ma ne obiro e nyasino.
Standard Group Chief Executive Officer Orlando Lyomu, who was the chief guest, said the exhibition would give Kenyans an opportunity to interact with Imbuga’s thoughts.	CEO mar Standard Group Orlando Lyomu ma ne en wendo modhial nowacho ni nyasino dhi miyo Jo-Kenya thuolo mar ng'eyo pach Imbuga.
He said the media requires more content and called on those with ideas on drama to come up.	Nowacho ni jofwambo dwaro paro manyien kendo nowacho ni jogo mong'eyo ndiko drama onego manye.
“Do not shy away from partnering with us, this will help us continue mentoring talents in honour of the late Imbuga,” said Lyomu.	"Lyomu nowacho kama, ""Kik iluor riwori kodwa, ma biro konyowa dhi nyime siro joma nigi mich ka waparogo Imbuga."""
To promote national heritage, Lyomu said, Standard Group will continue partnering with the Kenya National Archives, as it celebrates its heritage as the oldest media group in the region.	Lyomu nowacho ni Standard Group siro kano weche mag piny kokalo kuom tiyo kanyachiel gi Kenya National Archives sama gitimo nyasi mar bedo od fwambo mosebudho aming'a moloyo moro amora.
Other guests present were Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology Vice Chancellor Fred Otieno and his Kenyatta University counterpart Paul Wainaina.	Welo mamoko ma ne obiro ne en Vice Chancellor mar Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, Fred Otieno kod Paul Wainaina mar Kenyatta University.
During the exhibition, Kenya National Archives will not charge the public. The exhibition will run until April 2019.	E kinde ma nyasino dhi nyime, Kenya National Archives ok kwayo ji pesa mar donjo. Nyasino biro dhi nyime nyaka April 2019.
Dubbed “An Exhibition of Prof Francis Imbuga’s Literary Works”, the gallery is a package of his entire life, containing photos from his days as an actor.	"Pinchnigo ondik ni ni ""Ranyisi mag Gik ma Profesa Imbuga Nondiko"" kendo pichni man kanyo nyiso ngimane duto, moriwo nyaka pichni mag ndalo ma ne en jatugo."
Imbuga’s works have become key in the study of literature schools in Kenya, with the most famous one being Betrayal in the City.	Buge ma Imbuga ondiko itiyogo ahinya e skunde man Kenya ka buge mong'ere ahinya en Betrayal in the City.
It also has photos of his young family and those taken just before he died.	Oting'o bende pichni mag jood Imbuga kod pichni ma ne ogoye ka pok otho.
His other books include Aminata, Man of Kafira, The Burning of Rags and The Successor.	Buge mamako ma ne ondiko gin: Aminata, Man of Kafira, The Burning of Rags kod The Successor.
Imbuga’s works have consistently brought out issues that affect the society such as the clashes of modernity and tradition in the social organisation of African communities.	Buge ma Imbuga ondiko kinde mang'eny wuoyo e wi chandruoge ma ji romogo kaka wach ma ji laro e wi kaka ji odak sani kod owinjore Jo Afrika dag kaluwore gi kitgi machon.

He also narrated how the professor surprised him when he returned the typewriter.	Nowacho bende gima profesa notimone ka ne oduokone typewriter.

If we want to meet the dead looking alive we turn to art, said writer Hilary Mantel.	Jandiko miluongo ni Hilary Mantel nowacho ni ka wadwaro neno jomotho ka joma ngima, onego wang'I pichni.
An exhibition on the life and times of the late satirical playwright Francis Imbuga hopes to do just that.	Gik moket mineno manyiso ngima jandiko mong'ere Francis Imbuga biro nyiso adier mar wachno.
The exhibition, which opens tomorrow at the Kenya National Archives will showcase Imbuga’s life in pictures, writings and mementos spanning from his grandparents who turned him into storyteller to fun times quaffing his favorite Tusker beer with friends at the Kenya National Theatre.	Nyasi mar tang'o gigo dhi kiny e Kenya National Archives ka ginyiso pichni mag ngima Imbuga, buge ma ne ondiko kod gik miparego moa kuom kwerene mane omiyo obedo jasigana mang'ula kaka nomadhoga bia mar Tusker gi osiepene ka gin Kenya National Theatre.
Visitors will also be able to see original hand written manuscripts of his plays penned in an immaculate handwriting that his widow Prof Mabel Imbuga is still in awe of.	Ibiro tang' ne welo bende tuke mane ondiko gi lwete owuon kendo chiege Profesa Mabel Imbuga pod okanoga otesego nyaka chil kawuono.
“He had a very neat handwriting. He hardly made any mistakes and it’s something that really impresses me up to this day especially when I look at his first book,” she says.	"Chiege wacho kama, ""Lwete ne ndiko maywayo wang'. Ne yot mondo otim ketho to mano gima mora nyaka kawuono sama arango buk ma ne okwongo ndiko."""
While numbers are projected to grow three-fold by 2023, that still represents a small fraction of the region’s population. 	Kata obedo ni geno nitie ni kwan biro medore di nya didek ka ochopo higa gana ariyo piero ariyo gi adek – 2023, mano pod ochungne kwan ji matin ma odak e piny jorotenge.
Those figures make it clear that the region needs to address a major internet infrastructure shortfall.	Kwan go nyiso ayanga ni pinjego dwarore ni mondo orang matut kaka nyalo medo gero gigo ma kelo tudruok mar mbuyi bedo mayot.
The benefits of growing internet accessibility and access are obvious. 	Ber ma medruok mar tudruok gi weche mag mbuyi ong'ere maler.
In 2019, in Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 650 000 jobs were supported directly by the mobile ecosystem and more than 1.4-million informal jobs in 2019.	E higa gana ariyo gi apar gochiko – 2019, e gwenge mag Sub-Saharan Africa, moloyo tije gana mia auchiel gi piero abich – 650,000 ne oyudore e weche mag tiyo gi sime; kendo ji ma ohingo 1,400,000 bende ne ondiki e tije mag ji giwegi.
It also contributed more than US$17-billion to public funding through the course of the year.	Weche mag tudruok gi mbuyi no bende ne okelo medruok mar nyinyo mar jo America kod jo Ingeresa ma okalo tara gana apar gi abiriyo – 17,000,000.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also established that a 10% increase in mobile broadband penetration in Africa would generate an increase of 2.5% in GDP per capita. 	Riwruok maduong ma ochung'ne weche tudruok mag mbuyi e piny mangima - The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - ose lieko ni medruok maromo apar kuom mia achiel (10%) mag tudruok e yor mbuyi ei pinje mag jorotenge biro kelo medruok ma dirom kwan maromo ariyo gi sanja kuom mia (2.5%) e yuto mar piny owacho.
That’s to say nothing of the benefits that better and more affordable mobile internet can have on education, healthcare, and government services. 	Mano ka ok wawuoye e ber ma tudruok mar mbuyi e yoo mayot biro kelo e weche mag somo, thieth kod yore ma piny owacho tiyogo ne jopiny.
With easily accessible internet connectivity, people can search for jobs, gain new skills, and access government services without having to travel to a physical location and potentially stand in long queues.	Ka piny nyalo bedo gi tudruok mar mbuyi e yoo mayot, ji nyalo manyo tije, yudo tiegruok manyien maber kendo yudo konyruok kuom piny owacho ka ok gi dhi kunde ma joma tiyo ne piny owacho nitie kata chung mangeny kama joma dwaro konyruok kuom piny owacho chungie.
As we have seen, the pandemic has caused economic and social devastation and changed the way we live, work, study and socialize, bringing about an era of social distancing.     	Kaka waseneno, yamo marach mar korona okelo chandruok e weche mag dongruok kod konyruok mar oganda nikech okelo pogruok e yoo ma wadakgo; kaka watiyo, kaka wasomo kendo kaka walalore gi jowetewa ma koro okelo ngima mar bedo mabor gi joma moko.
One of the most significant changes is the acceleration of digital transformation. 	Achiel kuom dongruok madongo mobiro en ni piny medo ranginy mar tudruok e yor mbuyi.
African policymakers have realised that access to broadband is critical for mitigating the effects of the pandemic and boosting economic recovery in the post-Covid era.	Joma loso chike e pinje mag Afrika osefwenyo ni tiyo kod yore mbuyi kelo pogruok maduong' e yor konyo weche ma yamo marach no okelo kendo medo tego dongruok mar piny bang ka Corona ose rumo.
With changes in people’s behaviours and mindsets, broadband will also continue to provide opportunities for African countries to leapfrog obstacles to sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic development. 	Ka ji nyalo loko timbegi kod paro, weche mag tudruok e yor mbuyi bende biro medo kelo thuolo e pinje mag Afrika mar gik ma tamo dongruok mar oganda dhi nyime maber.
Of course, the responsibility to create access doesn’t lie with government alone. 	Kuom adieri, tich mar neno ni ji nigi tudruok e yor mbuyi ok en mar piny owacho kende.
Corporates also have a role to play. 	Riwruok ma moko bende nigi tich monego gitim e wachni.
At Huawei, we recognise this and have backed a number of initiatives that aim to help grow access in areas where it’s needed most	Wan kaka jo Huawei, wangeyo wach ni maber; ema omiyo wasebedo ka wakonyo yore mang'eny ma temo neno ni ji otudore gi yor mbuyi kuonde ma rem nitie.
In July last year, for example, we launched the DigiSchool project in partnership with a local operator and a non-profit organisation. 	Kuom ranyisi, dwe mar abirio higa ma okalo, ne wachako kar tiegruok mar tudruok e yor mbuyi (DigiSchool) ka wariwore gi achiel kuom jogo ma olony e wechego, ka watiyo kanyakla bende gi riwruok machielo ma konyo jopiny.
As response to the call to ensure that all South African school children can read fluently for meaning, the programme aims to connect more than 100 urban and rural primary schools to broadband internet.	Kaluwore gi dwaro ni nyithindo ma somo e piny South Africa onge somo maber manyalo konyogi, lek mar chenrono en ni mondo moloyo nyithindo 100 ma somo e kuode ma lony nitie (town) kod e ngwenge man ei piny obed gi tudruok eyor mbuyi
Additionally, we’ve rolled out DigiTrucks in several African countries, which enable everyone from students to entrepreneurs to learn how to use computers and connect with the digital world. 	Wach machielo en ni wase chako somo mar weche tudruok gi yor mbuyi ma waluongo gi dho ngere ni – DigiTrucks – e pinye mang'eny mag Afrika ma miyo ngato angata ka ochakore gi nyithindo masomo nyaka jo ohala; ma puonjogi kaka ginyalo tiyo gi kompyuta mondo gitudre gi ji ma odak e pinje ma oko.
Earlier this year, we also announced a partnership with Ghanaian operators to build more than 2000 base stations in remote areas of that country to connect the unconnected.	E chakruok mar higani, nyocha walando tiyo kanyakla achiel gi jogo ma kelo tudruok e yor mbuyi e piny Ghana; mar gero stesen ma okalo 2000 kuonde ma pod ni chien e pinyno mondo gi tud jogo ma pok oyudo tudruok maber e yor mbuyi.

Te Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) has stepped up its push to recover Sh385 million from a businessman it accuses of siphoning the money from the County Government of Mandera.	Bad piny owacho ma duoko mwandu mag jopiny koa kuom jok mane okawgi e yor mibadhi ma iluongo ni Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) ose medo kasore gi dwaro mar gi mar duoko ne piny owacho tara gana 385,000,000 mane ja ohala moro ne okwalo koa e piny owacho ma Mandera.
In submissions filed before the High Court, ARA claims that Ali Abdi Ibrahim cannot explain the source of the Sh385 million found in his two accounts and that the investigations have revealed the money was acquired from three companies that traded with the county government.	Kaluwore gi wach ma gitero e doho mamalo e Kenya, ARA wacho ni jago ma iluongo ni Ali Abdi Ibrahim ok nyal lero kama ne oyude omenda maromo 385,000,000 mane oyudi e akaunt ariyo ma okane pesa ne. ARA wacho ni nonro mar gi nyiso ni pesani ne oa e kembe moko adek mane timo ohala gi piny owacho ma Mandera.
State counsel Jennifer Gitiri representing the agency argued that an analysis of Ibrahim’s accounts showed a systematic pattern of money laundering where some of the amounts were deposited in cash while others were wired from other banks.	Okil ma ochungne piny owacho miluongo ni Jennifer Gitiri ne owacho e od bura ni kaluwore gi nonro mar gi e kunde keno mar Ibrahim, ne giyudo ni ne nitie kaka ne ja mibadhino tero pesa e kar keno magego kendo moko bende ne iorone ka oaye kuonde keno mamoko.
“The amounts are proceeds of crime that must be forfeited to the state. He has failed to prove how and why the suspicious cash transactions were deposited in his account. He cannot even show evidence of any business he transacted with the county government of Mandera,” said Gitiri.	"Gitiri ne owacho kama, ""Nikech omenda go ne oyudi e yor mibadhi, ibiro duok gi ne piny owacho. Ok nyal lero maber kaka kendo gima omiyo omenda ma nenore ni ne ok onwang’ e yo ma oriere go ne ochopo e kar keno mare. Ok onyal golo gima nyiso ni ne otimo ohala gi piny owacho ma Mandera."""
According to ARA, the huge amounts are suspected to have been stolen from the county government of Mandera and deposited to Ibrahim’s accounts to conceal the source when he has no legitimate businesses to generate the total amount.	Kalowore gi nonro mane otim gi KARA, kwan mageny go iparo ni ne okwal ka ooye piny owacho mar Mandera kendo ne oket gi e kar keno mar Ibrahim mondo kik fwenyre kama ne ogol gie nikech ngatni ne onge ohala ma ongere mane otimo mane nyalo miye pesa ma chal kamano.
Ms Gitiri submitted that the cash was being deposited in his account by unknown people and even after being summoned to explain, he could not tell where the money came from.	Nyadendi Gitiri ne ondiko ni kwan go ne ikete e kar keno mar ngat miluongo ni Ibrahim no gi ji ma ok oyangore maber kendo kane oluonge mondo oler kama pesa go ne owuokie to ne ok onyal lero maber kama ne gi aye
She said some of the cash deposit were made in tranches of below Sh1 million to avoid raising suspicion and that records at the Kenya Revenue Authority showed that he did not pay any taxes to prove he was trading with the county government.	Nyadendino ne owacho ni moko kuom kwan go ne oket e bengi mar keno mar ngatno mos mos kar pesa ma ok oromo tara gana achiel (1,000,000) mondo kik paro moro bedie ni ne gin mag miganga kendo jo sol osuru ma Kenya ma iluongo ni Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) ne oyango ni jalno ne ok ochulo osuru manyiso ni ne en gi ohala mane ogoyo gi piny owacho ma Mandera no.
“Without any evidence to substantiate the source of his funds, we are left with only one conclusion that they are proceeds of crime. His defence that he was sub-contracted by other companies to do construction work are baseless and lies meant to hoodwink the court,” said Gitiri.	“Ka onge gima nyiso kama pesa go ne oaye, wadong mana gi neno achiel kende ni pesa go ne oyudie e yo mar miganga. Wach ma owacho ni ne omiye kibaruwa ma bathe gi kembe ma moko mag gedo onge tiende kendo mirambo lilo ma odwa wuondo go od bura”.

"He added, “We have adopted a two-pronged strategy of being offensive and defensive. We strengthened our capital buffers by retaining profits and withholding dividend payouts, took long-term loan facilities that strengthened our liquidity buffers, supported host communities and our clients to mitigate the impact of the crisis on them by waiving fees and rescheduling their loans to match loan repayments to new cashflow patterns."""

According to CRA, Embu and Garissa have grown Own Revenue Source by 254 and 202 per cent respectively. From the same analysis, 15 counties including Tana River, West Pokot, Lamu, Kirinyaga, Mombasa, Nandi, Kiambu, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Laikipia, Taita Taveta, Marsabit, Makueni, Kakamega, Tharaka-Nithi and Nyandarua more than doubled their revenue over the first six years of devolution.

Speaking on the sidelines of Counties Own Source of Revenue report launch in Nairobi, CRA commissioner Dr Irene Koech also noted a decline in revenue collection in Busia, Wajir, Homa Bay and Mandera counties.

“County government’s main own-source revenue streams are business permits, property-related revenue and vehicle parking fees,” she says.

“Agriculture- dominated counties are disadvantaged by the narrowness of their significant revenue stream cess, which accounts for only 3 per cent of total county collections.”	“Piny Owacho ma nwango yuto margi ka oa e weche mag pur miluongo gi dho ngere ni chudo mar ‘cess’ ok ni ma ber ahinya nikech giyudo pesa matin maromo mana 3 ewi 100 kuom pesa duto ma gichoko e yor chulo osuru.”

In 2016-17 the three sources accounted for more than 40 per cent of the total own-source revenue for county governments. Specifically, property-related revenue contributed 14 per cent, business permits contributed 15 per cent, and vehicle parking fees contributed 12 per cent.

The report assessed the relationship of county economic activities and county own-source revenue. Diversification in economic activities was found to relate with high revenue collection.

Assessing county revenue streams, it was found out that Cess is immaterial as a proportion of total own-source revenue raising only 3 per cent.

“These counties collect less than Sh200 million annually on average, while counties that have more diverse economic activities collect more own-sources.

Just a year after the company wrote off Sh653 million it had invested in its subsidiaries in Uganda and Tanzania, the Nairobi Security Exchange (NSE) listed firm has now turned to its shareholders for more capital.

“If most of the people were vaccinated, it makes it easier for airlines because you have sufficient passenger load that is free to travel.

“We cannot act unilaterally. Kenya cannot say we require all passengers to have a Covid-19 passport while Rwanda, UK or Australia don’t require it, then what we will have is that passengers will avoid your airline and go to an airline that will accept Covid-ve test results.”	“Ok wanyal timo gima chalo kamano kendwa ma ok wawuoyo gi pinje ma moko.

Asset and wealth management firms are working on ways to use AI to improve their investment decisions and to extract insights from historical data, which should increase efficiency, accuracy and compliance.

With the global AI asset management market size expected to be worth almost USD13.5 billion within the next six years, it’s clearly a booming part of the business.

The development of technology in finance and computer-aided algorithms has also contributed to rising interest in low-cost, rules-based, quantitatively-oriented passive investment strategies.

Over the last five years, such strategies have grown by about USD2 trillion while traditional active management strategies declined by roughly the same amount.

This has been aided by minimal costs and strong performance due to the extended bull market.	Ma ose timore nikech tiyo gi pesa matin kod yuto maber nikech choro ma omedore.
However, these indices are now being rivalled by other weighting systems that deploy technology to deliver better outcomes and mitigate risks. 	Kata kamano, sani kor nitie yore moko mabeyo ma itiyogo maloyo machon go ma sani miyo tich bet mayot kendo lal bedo matin.
For example, as stakeholders increasingly focus on the harmful role of carbon in global warming and the importance of other ESG-related issues in mitigating portfolio and social risks, asset owners are using technology to adjust market capitalization-weighted benchmarks.	Kuom ranyisi, sama ji sani medo keto wangegi e yiro mamedo liet e piny kod weche mamoko machal kamago, jo mwandu to sani rango mana kaka ginyalo tiyo gi yor mbuyi kuom kelo medruok mar mwandu gi.
In this way, we expect the role of AI in index investing will have a knock-on effect of improving asset owner and asset manager decisions, focusing them on working with portfolio companies over longer time horizons and supporting companies that, for instance, need to transition away from poor carbon outcomes. 	Ka wadhi kama to nitie geno ni yore ma ji loso go mwandu ka gitiyo gi gik masani biro kelo yot ne jo mwandu kuom ngado bura kaka ginyalo dhi nyime maber, ka gitiyo kanyakla gi kembe ma ochungne yore mag loso mwandu. Kuom ranyisi, ginyalo konyo kembe madwaro weyo tiyo gi gigo ma golo iro mangeny e piny.
We further expect that this will lead asset owners to engage more transparently with their constituents (for example, pensioners or retail clients) to explain why such decisions are optimal.	Bende wan gi geno ni wach ni biro miyo jo mwandu wuoyo e yoo ma onge miriambo gi jogo ma gikonyore go machalo joma ose weyo tich kod ji achiel achiel ma konyore kuom gi ka ginyiso gi gima omiyo gingado bura kamano.
AI will gradually play a greater role in critically assessing human judgements in investment decision-making frameworks, to moderate or counter short-term behavioural biases or even to make judgements without human input.

This is an improvement on a currently very manual process that suffers from inherent human biases.	Ma en bedruok kuom yoo machon ma pod ji tiyogo man gi chandruok ma bede nikech dwaro mar dhano.

Firms will need to invest in experts to monitor the AI and ensure it functions and make adjustments when needed	Kembe biro dwaro mondo joma oluoch gi wach mar AI orangi kaka otiyo mondo one ni otimo tich maber kendo oketo puogruok kama dwarore.
This means that investment decisions will still be largely reliant on individual judgement and common patterns of biases, much like they have for the past 20 years.	Ma nyiso ni ngado bura kuom kaka jo mwandu nyalo bedo mwandu gi pod biro mana tim gi dhano kaluwore gi kaka dwaro mar dhano masani chal.
Using AI in investment management also creates new risks and challenges.	Tiyo gi AI e yor medo mwandu bende kelo lal kod chandruok ma moko e chiro.
A model is only as good as the data you put into it – so model opacity and data integrity matter. 	Ngama oloso gi lwet dhano nyalo mana tiyo maber kaluwore gi kit gigo ma okete.
And questions about the ethics in justifying or bounding AI investment decisions will also need to be answered, as well as issues surrounding the regulation of AI systems, the risks of heightened pro-cyclical investment activity and the current lack of a monitoring framework, as AI plays an ever-increasing role in the investment decision-making process.	Penjo kuom kaka ji biro bedo gi kido maber ka gitiyo gi AI kuom ngado bura mar ohala bende biro dwarore mondo oduoki maber, ka achiel gi chike matayo kaka AI owinjore oti, chandruok ma tiyo gi yoo manyien ni nyalo kelo kendo gi bedo maonge yoo ma inyalo pim go kaka otiyo nikech AI konyo ahinya kuom ngado bura kaka jomwandu nyalo kelo bedruok e mwandu gi.
These questions matter because of the need to maintain and improve the level of trust and confidence in investment management and the broader financial system in general.

This is partially achieved by explaining transparently how ethical and social responsibility factors can be included in the investment decision-making process at the portfolio, strategic and regulatory levels, so that AI can be developed with proper balance.

At the same time, trust and confidence can only be gained if frameworks are developed to control pro-cyclical investment activity, monitor AI decision-making impacts in financial markets, and enforce the role of human interaction in the investment-management process to oversee and communicate decisions (whether by human or AI).	E seche go, bedo gi chung ma ojawore kod yie ma otego no nyalo mana bede ka nitie yore ma oketi mondo otaa kaka AI tiyo kendo chero kaka bura ma ogandi ka itiyo gi rieko manyien ni kelo pogruok e yore ma pesa ringe e piny kendo keto chike ma tayo kaka dhano biro tiyo gi Ai e yore duto ma dwarore - obed ni en tich dhano kata AI.

In order to allow for these positive developments, we need to identify the key stakeholders to manage and encourage positive AI development in the investment management process.

Regardless of regulation and monitoring systems, asset managers also need to take it on themselves to address some of these issues in their existing investment process.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) to partner with relevant State agencies to standardise their products for the export market.	Ker Ohuru Kenyatta ogolo chik ne bad Piny Owacho ma yango chiaye – Kenya Meat Commision – mondo oti kanyakla achiel gi bede Piny Owacho mamoko ma timo tije ma oyiengore gi gima gitomo mondo opim ringo ma giyango ma inyalo usi e chiro ma ooko.
The president, who was speaking during the official re-opening of KMC in Athi River, Machakos County yesterday, said he was optimistic of the meat products reaching the European market.	Ker no ma nyo owuoyo e nyasi mar yawo kar yang’o ringo (KMC) ma oger Athi River e Piny Owacho ma Machakos ne owacho ni en gi adieri ni ringo ma iyango kanyo biro chopo e pinje mag jo wagunda.
“We have done it before when Kenyan meat and meat products were sold worldwide and I believe once again meat products should join the growing list of food items that we export to the rest of the world,” he said.	“Nitie kinde mane wase uso ring'o ma oa Kenya e piny mangima; kuom mano, an gi yie ni ring'o bende owinjore obed achiel kuom chiemo ma watero e pinje ma oko.” Ne owacho kamano.
The Head of State said he expects the country’s beef exports to also hit the Middle East as well as emerging markets, where the population is growing and consumers have more purchasing power.	Jatend piny ne owacho ni ogeno ni ring'o ma Kenya tero oko biro chopo e pinje mag warabu gi chirni masani yudore kunde ma moko ma kwan dhano medore kendo ji nigi pesa maber mar ng'iewo gigo ma gidwaro.
“The Africa continental free trade arrangement coming into force provides an opportunity that should benefit the livestock sector by harnessing the entire supply chain in the meat industry,” he said.	“Chenro mar jo Africa mar loso chiro maduong ma ji ni thuolo mar uso maonge weche mageny biro kelo ohala ne joma pidho jamni ma biro miyo nengo chiaye dhi malo ka oa kuom japith, ja uso, ngama loso ringo nyaka chop kuom jachiemo.” Ne owacho kamano.
The Head of State said the livestock sector’s potential extends to hides and skin, which informed his administration’s push to breathe life into the tannery industry.	Jatend piny ne owacho ni pidho chiaye nigi yore mag loso pesa machalo kaka uso piende kendo ma ema omiyo ne sirikande otemo matek mar neno ni kama ing'iewe piende bende koro tiyo.
The president, while lauding the positive changes at the commission since its transfer to the Ministry of Defence, said time was ripe for KMC to reclaim its role in the country’s economy.	Ker, ka puoyo lokruok maber ma jo lweny okelo e kar yango ringo no – Kenya Meat Commision (KMC) bang kete e bwo Migawo Ma Rito Piny (Minstry of Defence) ne owacho ni saa ose chop ne KMC mondo ochak okel dongruok e piny Kenya.
He said interest from Kenya Prisons, National Youth Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, and police training college contracting KMC for their supplies was a sign of the renewed trust in the commission.	Ne owacho ni bedo ni migepe sirikal mag Jo Jela – Kenya Prisons, Joma Tiego Nyithindo – National Youth Service, Joma Rito Le – Kenya Wildlife Service kod Joma tiego Obila – Police Training College dwaro miyo KCM tich mar tero negi ringo ma gichamo nyiso ni ji sani nigi yie kuom jo yang’ ringo no.
KMC, which was initially under the Ministry of Agriculture, was in September 2020 transferred to the Ministry of Defence.	KMC, ma chon yande ni e bwo Migawo Mar Pur ne olok oter e Migawo Mar Rito Piny.
While the move has been contested in court, President Kenyatta yesterday defended the decision albeit with a lot of care.	Kata obedo ni wach mar lokruok no oseter e doho mondo ong'i ane ka bende ne otime ka oluwore gi chike mag piny Kenya, Ker Kenyatta nyoro otemo lero ni gino ne otim kaluwore gi chike mag Kenya, kotang'.
“Past administration has made efforts to jumpstart KMC, but for reasons which are known never succeeded and a lot of public funds went astray,” he said.	“Pich Owacho mokalo ne otemo mar chiero KMC to nikech weche ma ong'ere, ne ok gichiere kata obedo ni pesa mar jopiny to ne okethore kamano.” Ne owacho.
He noted the transfer had eased payments to farmers — some who had gone for four years without compensation after supplying animals.	Ne owacho ni luokruok mane obedono omiyo jo pith chiaye sani yudo chudo margi mayot – moko kuom gi ne osebet higni ang'wen ka ok ochulgi.
The commission plans to pay farmers within 72 hours.	KMC nigi chenro mar chulo weg chiaye e kinde ma ok ngeny ne seche 72.
“The commission’s business reorganisation plan has kicked off in earnest with offsetting debts to all farmers,” said Defence Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma.	“Lokruok mar kaka KMC sani timo ohala ose chakore e ngas ma malo ka gichulo gope mag jopith dhok mane pok gichulo”.
President Uhuru calls on Kenya Meat Commission to pay farmers within 72 hours after delivery	Ker Ohuru ne owacho ne bad sirikal ma yango’ ringo no mondo ochul jo pith kod jo ohand chiaye pesa gi ka pok seche 72 orumo bang’ ka gise kelo thoge gi kanyo.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on the new management of the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) to ensure livestock farmers are paid within 72 hours of animal delivery to the facility.	Ker Ohuru Kenyatta okene joma sani tayo kar nego chiaye no (KCM) mondo one ni gichulo joma kelo ne gi dhok e kind seche 72 bang’ ka gise miyo gi dhok.
Speaking when he officially relaunched the Athi-River based facility the president said KMC has the potential to play a significant role in Kenya’s economy. 	Ka ne owuoyo e  nyasi mar chiero KMC man Athi River, Ker ne owacho ni KMC nigi thuolo mar kelo dongruok e piny Kenya kaluwore ringo ma gi uso.
He challenged the facility to not only focus on meeting meat demand locally but plan on exporting the surplus to Europe, Middle East and Africa.	Ker ne ojiwo jo yang’ ringo go mondo kik gi tem mano miyo Jo Kenya ringo to ber ka gi bedo gi chenro mar tero ringo ma odong’ e pinje jo wagunda, warabu kod Africa.
“I don’t want to see KMC slipping back to olden days when farmers were paid after four years or not paid, maintain the payment period at 72 hours,” said Uhuru.	“Ok adwar neno KMC ka dong chien e ndalo mane jo pith dhok ne ichulo bang’ higi agwen kata bedo ni ok ochul gi; kuom mano, owinjore gi siki ka gi chulo joma miyo gi dhok go kapok seche 72 orumo ma en ka pok juma achiel orumo.” Ohuru ne owacho kamano.
“As we focus on the European and Middle East markets, let us also focus on Africa where the population is growing and consumers growingly have better purchasing power,” he added also noting the new African Continental Free Trade Area offers better opportunities.	Ka sani koro wangiyo kaka wanyalo tero ringo loka e pinje mag wasunge kod warabu, ber ka wangiyo uru bende kaka wanyalo uso ringo e Africa ka; kama nitie medruok mar dhano kendo kama jo chiemo bende sani koro nigi pesa maber mar ngiewo gik ma gidwaro.” Ne owacho kamano ka omedo ni riwruok mar pinje mag jo Africa ma sani biro keto thuolo mar uso gik moko ma onge akwede kata weche mangeny ma miyo uso bedo matek biro miyo johala kinde maber mar uso gige gi thuolo.

“The principal object of this Bill is to amend the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, No. 5 of 2018 to provide for the prohibition against the sharing of pornography through the Internet,” notes the amendments in the Bill proposed by Garissa MP Adan Duale.	“Gima duong ma chik ma nyien ni dwaro timo en ni mondo oloki chik ma chon mar tiyo kod computer marach kod ketho chik sama ngato tiyo gi yoo mbuyi ma en chik namba 5 mane okale e higa 2018 mondo mi omed rido matek ne joma keyo picha mag jogo man duge ka okalo e yoo mbuyi – internet – mondo ji one.” Mano e gima loko chik no wacho e kwayo mar ja chung’ ma od bura ma Garissa Moluor Adan Duale.

In an affidavit to support their case, the Law Society of Kenya Chief Executive Mercy Wambua cites cases where specific individuals had been arrested under the law accused of disseminating false information in respect to Covid-19 related deaths.

Manufacturers can only get Value Added Tax (VAT) refunds on unsold stock.	Kembe maloso gik moko inyalo mana duok negi chudo mar osuru e gik ma ok gi uso.
This follows a High Court ruling against a petition by three drug manufacturers.	Ma e kaka   nyocha ongad bura gi duond od bura ma malo e Kenya – High Court of Kenya – bang’ kembe adek ma loso yedhe tero wach no e od bura.
High Court Judge Weldon Korir, while dismissing the petition, noted that the manufacturers had not indicated the unsold stock on which they claimed a refund of VAT input tax. 	Jayalo mar od bura ma malo e Kenya Wedon Korir ka wito oko Burano, nyocha owacho ni kembe ma loso yedhe go ne ok olero kar romb yedhe ma ok ne uso mane gidwaro ni mondo kik gi chul negi osuru mar uso gik moko – Value Added Tax (VAT).
Previously known as sales tax, VAT is levied at consumption at a maximum rate of 16 per cent.	Chon ne iluongo ni chulo osuru kuom gima ousi – Sales Tax, VAT sani idwaro ni ichulo gi jo ngiepo kum pesa ma Kenya moromo 16 e wi 100.
“They merely indicated figures which may have included sold stock and this may be unfair and unjust enrichment on their part since the inclusion of sold stock in the figures would mean that the petitioners would benefit by getting input tax relief from the first respondent - Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) - for tax already passed on to consumers,” said Justice Korir in his May 31 ruling.	Ne gi chiwo mana kwan mane nyalo riwo gik mane gise uso; to ma ok ne bi bedo maber nikech jogo ne ibiro duok negi pesa kuom gik mane gise uso ka oa kuom bad Piny Owacho ma choko osuru – Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) mane jo ngiepo ochulo sirikal.”  Jayalo maduong Korir ne ongado bura kamano e ndiko mare mar dwe mar Abich Tarik 31.
Refunding VAT paid for raw materials has been a subject of numerous litigation between the taxman and taxpayers, with the government allocating Sh10 billion for the payment of “verified” VAT refund claims.

Universal Corporation Ltd, Elys Chemical Industries Ltd and Dawa Ltd had on December 5, 2017, petitioned the court to declare that they were entitled to VAT refunds, which they had paid for the raw materials bought for their supplies that had until September 2015 had been tax-exempt.	Kembe ma iluongo ni Universal Corporation Ltd, Elys Chemical Industries Ltd kod Dawa Ltd tarik 5.12.2017 ne odhiye e od bura ma Kenya ka gikwayo ni mondo od bura ongadi ni owinjore oduok negi osuru mar uso gik moko – VAT mane gichulo ka gi ngiewo gik ma gitiyo go mane chon nyaka dwe mar ochiko 2015 ne ok gi chul ne osuru.
A tax-exempt item is not part of any tax calculations, which is why the manufacturers could not claim input tax. 	Gik ma ok chul ne gi osuru ok gogo kwan mar chulo osuru, mano ema omiyo kembe ma loso gik moko go ne ok nyal dwaro mondo oduok negi osuru mane gi chulo e yoo ma owinjore.
If a good or business is “exempt”, the government doesn’t tax the sale of the good, but producers cannot claim a credit for the VAT they pay on inputs to produce it.	Ka gimoro kata kambi ok owinjore ochul osuru, sirikal ok kaw osuru kuom gigo ma giuso. Kata kamano, kembe ok oyie negi kwayo ni mondo oduok negi osuru ma gise chulo kuom gik ma gitiyogo e loso gik ma giuso.
For a zero-rated good, the government does not tax its sale, but allows credits for the value-added paid on inputs.	Kuom gino ma ok chule osuru, Piny Owacho ok kwa osuru kuom uso mare, to ngato oyiene kwayo ni mondo oduok ne pesa mane otiyo go lose.
However, the Finance Act of 2015 moved these supplies from a tax-exempt status to zero-rated. 	Kata kamano, chik mane Piny Owacho oketo 2015 ma tayo kaka pesa owinjore oti e Kenya ne ogolo gik moko ma iuso ka oaye gik ma owenegi chulo osuru ka tero gi kuom gik ma owinjore oti go nono maonge chulo osuru.
A section of the VAT Act, 2013 stipulated that wherein future legislation the exempt supplies become taxable after a person had incurred input VAT, the person could claim VAT as long as the claim is lodged within three months from the date the exempt supply become zero-rated.	Kamoro e chik mar chulo osuru mar uso gik moko – VAT mane olosi 2013 wacho ni chike ma ibiro losi bange manyalo dwaro ni osuru mondo ochul kuom gima ngato ose chule osuru sama ilose, ngato nyalo kwayo sirikal – KRA mondo oduok ne osuru mane ochulono ka dweche adek pok orumo chakre ne keti ni gima chalo kamano koro onge osuru ma ichulo ne.
“Parliament was clear that it did not want taxpayers to recover reliefs from supplies that had already been made and which were previously exempt supplies,” said Justice Korir. 	"Jang'ad bura Korir ne owacho, “Od bura ma loso chike e Kenya ne olero ni ne ok gidwar jo sol osuru mondo oduok negi pesa mane owene kuom gik ma gise uso mane sirikal oweyo kawe osuru."""
It is noted that zero-rated products are cheaper for consumers since the suppliers are allowed to claim the cost of input tax and not pass it to consumers as is the case with exempt supplies.	Nenore ni gik ma ok chulne gi osuru bech gi yot ne jo ngiepo nikech Piny Owacho oyie dwoko ne jo uso osuru mane gichulo kuom gik maka mago ma ok gi medo e nengo mar jo ngiepo mondo ochul kaka timore gi osuru ma sirikal oweyo kawo kuom gik mamoko ma iuso.
KRA had rejected the petitioners’ claim because they lodged it outside of the right period, which is three months since the law took effect on June 15, 2015.

One of the biggest lies is that the only way for Africans to develop is to burn huge amounts of fossil fuel.	Achiel kuom miriambo mantie en ni mondo jo-Afrika ma Africa obed gi dongruok, nyaka gitii gi mo mikunyo modhuro.
But this dirty energy accounts for more than 80 per cent of planet-heating greenhouse gases.	To teko mar mach ma gitiyo gogo kelo liet e piny marom atamalo 80 mamiyo piny bedo gi liet.

Not surprisingly, those with vested interests in profiting from this climate pollution have given the go-ahead to the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), which cuts through the east African backcountry, from Western Uganda to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean port in Tanga, almost 1,500km away.	Gima ok opoyowa, jogo ma dwaro yudo ohala kuom miyo Africa bedo gi muya marach ose miyo thuolo ne East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), ma ringo ka oa Uganda nyaka Tanzania tho nam chumbi (Indian Ocean) ma Tanga, bor ne en ondamo 1,500 e kind kama ochakorego kod gikone.

Joma timo kama gin wasunge man gi kar kano pesa (bank) ma wacho ni dwaro gi mar loso pesa chalre gi dwaro mag joma chandore ma odak Africa.
What a lie! In the case of EACOP, French company Total and China National Offshore Corporation, are among the international financiers keen on profiting from Africa’s climate catastrophe.

En gima ber neno ka jopiny ma wachni rach negi ka keto matek ne kembe ma oko man gi pesa ma oolo pinje mondo kik gi gol pesa mar gero olalo mar moo no.
Banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse came out to categorically state that they would not participate in financing EACOP.	Jo Bank mar Barclays kod Credit Suisse ne owuok a lela ma owacho ni ok gib bedo achiel kuom kembe ma biro miyo EACOP pesa.

Concerted efforts by groups like deCOALonize through initiatives such as Save Lamu have rallied actors in climate action to make a stand against fossil fuels, leading to the stoppage of a proposed coal-fired plant in the UNESCO world heritage site off the Kenyan coast in Lamu.

Solar power alone can today meet the world’s global energy demands if it could be harnessed correctly, as it is estimated that the amount of radiation from the sun that reaches the earth in one year is sufficient to meet our energy demands for 7,000 to 8,000 years at the current rate of consumption.

I recently stumbled upon an old photo showing a long and meandering queue of taxpayers outside Times Tower, Nairobi, waiting to submit their annual tax returns. 	Nyocha apo ka arodhno gi picha moro ma nyiso kaka ji yande riedo e laini mabor oko mar od solo osur ma iluongo ni Times Towers, Nairobi, ka girito mondo gi chiw duoko mag gi mar chulo osuru.
Although the photo is not dated, it could have been years back before the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) automated filing of tax returns.	Kata obedo ni picha no onge gi tarik, onyalo bedo higni ma machon ka ne bad Piny Owacho ma solo osuru – Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) ne pok oketo timo tije gi e yor mbuyi.
The long queue could have meant two things.	Laini ma bor ni ne nyalo nyiso gik moko ariyo:
It was either the last day or a few days to end of June when submission of annual tax returns falls due. 	Ne onyalo bedo odiechieng’ ma ogik or ndalo matin ka due mar Auchiel pok orumo ma owinjore obedi ni ngato ka ngato ooro e duoko ne mar chulo osuru e hik sirikal ma rumo e dwe mar Auchiel no.
The situation in that photo got me wondering, what would have happened if submission of annual tax returns was still manual at this time when physical engagements have been restricted as part of the Covid-19 containment measures?	Gima ne aneno e picha no ne okawa gi wuoro; ang’o ma de otimore ka de bed ni ooro duoko mar solo osuru pod ne itero gi ji ma ok e yoo mbuyi ahinya sani ma idwaro ni ji kik rom mang’eny nikech wach tuo mar Corona?
Would this have called for taxpayers to line up at KRA offices in shifts to submit their tax returns?	Iparo ni ma ne nyalo miyo jo sol osuru kone gi ni mondo ipang laini bang’ grup ka grup ka gi ooro ripot osuru gi?
How safe would this have been for the taxpayers and KRA staff?	Iparo ni timo kamano de obedo ma onge rach ma nyalo wuoke kuom jo sol osuru kachiel gi jo tich mar KRA?
Thankfully, the iTax system is in place. 	Gima duong’ en ni ooro duoko mar solo osuru sani itimo gi e yor mbuyi (internet) ka okale chenro ma KRA luongo ni iTax system.
iTax is a self-service system that enables taxpayers to conduct tax business such as personal identification number (PIN) registration, tax payment, ledger maintenance, application for tax compliance certificates and waiver application, among others.	iTax en chenro ma ngato timo gimoro amora kende. Ma miyo jo sol osuru timo weche mag chiwo duoko kaka ng'ato osolo osuru machalo – dwaro namba ma ichiwo gi KRA – PIN, chulo osuru, neno ni ikano weche ni mag solo osuru maber, dwaro barua ma nyiso ni ise bedo ka ichulo osuru maber, kwayo mondo oweni chulo osuru gi mamoko.
Taxpayers can do all these from the comfort of their homes or offices. 	Sani jo sol osuru nyalo timo magi duto ka gin e ute gi kata e ofis ma ok gidhi ka KRA.
The iTax system is especially handy at this moment when taxpayers are filing their 2020 annual tax returns. 	Yoo ma ichiwo go duoko mar chulo osuru - iTax system sani koro ber ahinya sama koro ji chiwo duoko mag gi mar chulo osuru e higa 2020.

“Global Partnership for Ethiopia is a consortium of reputable telecom companies providing service to over 750 million customers all over the world and committed to create new jobs, support the economy through introduction of new and efficient services,” said Ethiopia Communications Authority (ECA) Director General Balcha Reba.	“Global Partnership for Ethopia en winjruok mar kembe ma ongere mag ogwe yamo m sani nigi jo ngiepo ma romo million 75 (75,000,000,000) e piny mangima; gin kembe ma temo mondo oyaw kunde ma ginyalo ndiko ji tich ka gikonyo e yor dongruok e piny kuom kelo yore manyien mag timo tich.” Ma nyo owachi gi jatelo mar bad sirikal mangiyo yore tudruok e piny Ethopia (Ethiopia Communications Authority (ECA) Migosi Balcha Reba.

Global service providers have been waiting in anticipation for the liberalisation of Ethiopia’s telecommunications market that began more than three years ago when the Council of Ministers agreed to partial privatisation of Ethio Telecom and the issuance of two other operating licences. 	Kembe mag ogwe yamo matiyo e piny magima ose bet ka rito gi geno mondo piny Ethopia oyaw thuolo ne jo go ohala e yor ogwe yamo mane ochalkore higni adek ma ose kalo kane bura mar jotend migepe owinjore ni sirikal owe jomoko ongiew kaka ginyalo bedo jo kanyono e kambi sirikal miluongo ni Ethio Telecom kendo chiwo barupe ariyo ne joma dwa timo ohala mag weche tudruok.

While inviting bids at the end of last year, ECA said service providers needed to comply with strict technical and financial qualifications to demonstrate the company had the capacity to manage a licence of its scale.

“Under these licences, service providers will have the right to provide any telecommunication service, including voice, text and data using any technology whether fixed or wireless anywhere within Ethiopia and to send and receive telecommunications to and from outside Ethiopia,” said the authority in its call for bids.	“Kuom barua ma ibiro migi no, weg kembe go biro bedo gi thuolo mar timo tiche ma opogore opogore ma tiyo gi waya kod ma ok ti gi waya ei Ethiopia, manyalo bedo gi tudruok jok man oko mar Ethiopia,” Bad piny owacho ne ondiko kamano e sama ne gi luongo ji mondo oor kwayo gi.

“In addition, the licences will provide each of the licensees the right to obtain access to scarce resources such as radio frequency spectrum, numbering and addressing resources and rights of way with considerations to the time frame to be allotted to the incumbent operator to complete frequency re-farming activities,” said ECA.

Two suspects have been arrested and are helping the DCI with investigations.	Ji ariyo ma ichich go ni nyocha otimo gima kama ose maki kendo sani konyo okach kich gi nono wach no maber.

Kinoti said the racket also involved other junior officers, including a driver.	Kinoti ne owacho ni wach mar wuondo ji e yor manyo tich no ne nitie jomoko bende mane tiyo gi achich maduong no mane oriwo nyaka jariemb mitoka.
The driver is said to have pocketed Sh5.7 million from unsuspecting job seekers, who were required to pay between Sh300,000 and Sh400,000 to secure jobs.

Kinoti said one victim, a woman, was from Kiambu.	Kinoti nyocha owacho ni ngama ne gi mayo no ne en mama moro ma odak Kiambu.
She claims to have been conned of Sh800,000 and promised that her three children would secure jobs at the National Health Insurance Fund, Nairobi Metropolitan Services and the Kenya Ports Authority.	Ne owacho ni ne omaye alufu mia aboro (800,000) kane osing’ ne ni obiro ndik ne yowuote adek ibiro yud negi tiche ka National Health Insurance Fund, Nairobi Metropolitan Services and the Kenya Ports Authority.
The woman however reported the matter to the police after the contacts failed to respond to her calls and claimed that the job offers had been affected by Covid-19 restrictions.

Another group of victims who had paid huge amounts of cash to secure jobs were treated to drama when they were taken to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for a familiarisation tour.

One crisp morning five years ago, armed with Sh500, 29-year old Nelson Mandela embarked on a fashion design journey.	Chieng’ moro gi okinyi higi abich ma okalo, ka en gi shilling 500 kende, ja hig ni 29 Nelson Mandela ne odhi e wuoth mar ngiyo yor  rwakruok.
He was new in the city and was excited about taking a gamble.	Ne en wendo e dala mar Nairobi to ne omor mar temo hape.
He crossed fingers and, like a South African namesake, took a leap into the unknown, armed with faith and confidence.	Ne omiyo lwetene kendo kaka ja South Africa mane ochake, ne ochako timo gima ne pok otimo e ngima ne, ka en gi yie kod chir.
Mandela walked into Gikomba market and bought two pairs of shoes each at Sh250. 	Mandela ne odhi Kikomba ma ongiwo wuoch tielo ariyo mar shilling 250 moro ka moro.
When he came back to the Central Business district, he sold the shoes at Sh4,500 a pair.	Kane oduogo e dier town mar Nairobi kama ji timo e ohala, ne ouso wuoch nego shilling 4,500 wuoche achiel.
He was only two years old in Nairobi but seemed like he had identified a niche for himself.	Ne ose dak mana Nairobi higni ariyo to nenore ni ne ose yudo tich ma onyalo timo mar konyruok.
He was completing his supply chain management course at Kenya Institute of Management, but here was his heart falling for fashion.	Ne ogik tieko tiegruok mare mar somo ngiewo gik ma itiyo e ofisi kama isome weche mag ohala - Kenya Institute of Management.
And the shoes kicked it off perfectly, literally.	Ouso wuoch gi ne omiyo ochako maber, gima nenore.
Buoyed by the returns, Mandela, who later joined a fashion school, started buying and selling shoes to make profits. 	Ka en gi ilo nikech ohala ma oyudo e wi wuoche ka wuoche kuom wuoch ariyo mane ouso go, ne omedo ngiewo kendo uso wuoch mondo oyud pesa mar ohala.
It was in the process of selling that he found excited clients asking him what outfits could match the shoes.	E kinde mane ouso wuochi gi ema ne oyudo jo ngiepo ma penje kit lewni mane inyalo rwwak gi wuoch go ma owinjore kod gi maber.
It was time to climb a step higher on the ladder.	Saa ne ochopo mar idho ngas dhi maloyo ma oloyo.
Mandela seized the opportunity and ventured into cloth production.	Mandela ne okawo thuolono ma odoje e twango welni.
Now, he owns Logical Clothing, a production house in Kimathi Street’s Eagle House where people order for classy, tailor made outfits.	E seche gi en gi kambi ma iluongo ni Logical Clothing, kama ji twang’e lewni ma nengo gi tek man e ot miluongo ni Eangle House, e wang’a yoo ma Kimathi street, Nairobi.
“This is what I wanted from the outset. I started selling shoes and in 2017 and now dealing with clothing. I pursued procurement in college, which I have never used in the field. My drive to make it in the clothing industry has driven me this far,” says the young entrepreneur, crisp in a suit he has made himself.	“Ma e gima ne adwaro chakre chon. Ne achako uso wuoch to ka ochopo higa 2017 nyaka sani to atwang’o lewni. Ne asomo weche mag ngiewo gik moko e school ma ikawe kos ma pok atiyo go nyaka sani. Dwacha mar neno ni adhi maber e tweng’o ema ose kela kama sani antiere ni.” Wuoyi matin ma ja ohala ni ne owacho kamano ka orwako law sut ma otwang’o kende.
His suits, which is what he majorly deals in, are priced between Sh13,500 and Sh150,000.	Sude ne ma mano e gima otwang’o mang’eny, ouso e kind shilling alufu 13,500 kod 150,000.
When a customer orders, he takes two weeks to work on the order and deliver.	Ka ngato dwaro sut, okawo juma ariyo mondo olos ne ma oter ne.
However, it takes longer with mass orders.	Kata Kamano, kaw ndalo ma okalo kanyo ka oyudo tich mang’eny.
“Some of these suits incur huge production costs. A suit I sold for Sh65,000 cost me around Sh50,000 to produce.”	“Moko kuom sude ma aloso kaw pesa mang’eny; sut ma auso shilling 65,000 kawa shilling 50,000 mondo alosi.”
Mandela, who specialises in corporate suits, wedding suits, events outfits, Ankara dresses for ladies, bridal dresses, khaki pants, and who also sells shoes and shirts, says that one of the most important things that every tailor should have is a production house.	Mandela, ma ng’eny ne loso mana sude mag kembe, arus, lewni mag nyasi, lep mon, lep mon mag arus, lewni matindo mag endni, ma bende uso wuoch kod sede, wacho ni gima duong ma ngama kuocho nyaka bed go en kar tich.
“People want a physical location where they can visit to see what is happening and can launch complaints. It gives them confidence in the business.”	“Ji dwaro kama ngato tiye ma ginyalo bire mondo gi ne gima timore kendo gi wach gima gineno ka ok ber negi. Ma miyo gi bedo gi adieri gi tich ma itimo negi.”
He has employed three tailors, one delivery person and an office messenger, and plans to create a bigger empire going into the future.	Sani ondiko funde adek ma kuocho, ngat achiel ma tero lewni ne jo ng’iepo, ngat machielo ma loso kar tich; opango medo kar tich mondo obed maduong kaka ndalo dhi.
“I came to Nairobi in 2014 and by the time I started this business, I was still very green in the city. I started off with Sh500. It was a gamble, but worthwhile. Since, I believe in myself and in every venture I pursue,” says the entrepreneur.	“Ne abiro Nairobi e higa 2014 kendo ndalo mane achako ohala ni, pod ne an wendo ka. Ne achako gi shilling 500.  Ne en temo hap ngato; to aneno ka ber mondo atim mano! Chakre kanyo, sani koro ang’eyo ni anyalo timo gimoro amora ma aketo e chunya ni adwa timo.” Ja ohalo no ne owacho kamano.
“I have a son and I do not want him to be ravaged by the misery poverty took me through.” Mandela says that he stands out because he is customer-centric.	“An gi wuoyi to ok adwar ni en be one chandruok mane akale.” Mandela wacho ni odhi maber nikech ong’iyo weche mag jo ng’iepo maber.
In my company, we are all about meeting the deadline and expectations of the customer.	E kambi na, gima watemo timo maduong en neno ni waloso ne joma ng’iewo wa gik ma gidwaro e seche ma idwaro giye kendo loso gi maber kaka dwarore.
I believe in customer satisfaction, which leads to referrals.	An atemo mondo atim gima moro ja ng’iepo; ma ema miyo gi kelo na jo ng’iepo ma moko
A satisfied customer will pass the good news to another potential one, creating a chain. 	Jo ng’iepo ma odhi ka mor biro lando tim maber no ne ng'at machielo ma nyalo ng'iepo; ma miyo ibedo gi ji mang’eny ma dwaro ni iti negi.
We sell quality clothes; we do not edit photos to promote our brand. 	Wa uso lewni ma beyo; ok wang’i pichni man e buk mondo omed wa rieko mar tweng’o.
Unlike many tailors, he is careful with customers’ money.  	Ok kaka jo tweng’o ma moko, en ngama odan’g gi weche mag pesa mag joma ng’iewe.
A running joke in this country goes that unless one supervises his tailor and carries weapons that is threatening enough, the tailor will never deliver.	Ngero mantie e Kenya en ni mondo ngato yud gima odwaro, nyaka eket jatweng’o ka-gi-ka kendo nyaka ibed ni gige lweny ma nyalo buge maber; ka ok kamano, ja twengo ok bi tieko loso ni nanga.
“This industry requires discipline. Customers give us money in advance and if one is not disciplined, you will spend the money and end up grappling with unfinished clothes when delivery time comes.”	“E twengo ka dwaro mondo ngato obed man gi luor. Jo tweng’o miya pesa chon, omiyo ka ngato onge luor maber, ibiro tyo gi pesa kata giko ne to ok ibi loso nanga marum e sama idware.”
Among many other dignitaries that Mandela has dressed include Migori Governor Okoth Obado, Uriri MP Mike Ogolla, CIC Insurance Group General manager Jack Kionga, Natalie Mukundane (Executive Chairperson at African Youth Commission), King Kaka and the whole Kaka Empire and a lot of MCAs.	Kuom jotelo ma Mandela ose twengo negi gin kaka Jetend Piny Owacho ma Migori Okoth Obado, ja od bura maduong ma Uriri Mike Ogola, Jatelo mar CIC insurance Jack Kionga, Natalie Mukundane ma en jatend joma tindo man Africa, King Kaka kod jogene duto kod MCAs – jo chung mag kor ng’wenge mang’eny.
Some of the challenges he has to weather include dealing with rogue customers, but he has learnt to handle them.	Gik ma seche moko chune ni nyaka kor one kaka otimo en loso gi jong’iepo ma tich gi tek; kata kamano, ose puonjore kaka onyalo wuoyo kod gi.
Sometimes I face clients who do not want to pay.	Seche moko aromo gi jo ng’iepo ma ok dwar chudo.
Some complain about small details they feel do not please them and want to default payment.	Moko kuom gi wacho kunde moko ok olosore maber ma ok mor gi ma koro miyo ok gidwar chudo.
However, we strike a dialogue and are able to reach a solution.	Kata kamano, wawuoyo awuoyo ma wa winjre maber.
His role model is Robert Pauley III, famously known as The Wealth Guy, a New York City fashion designer who Mandela describes as a very talented and smart man.	Ngat ma more en Pauley III, ma ongere kaka ja mwandu; ma tweng’o New York ma Mandela wuoyo kuome kaka chal ma Nyasaye omiyo rieko kendo ngat maler.
Has he ever wanted to quit?	Bende nitie ndalo mane ose dwaro ni owe gima otimo?
In 2018, things were not going well as I was so hard pressed that I wanted to go back to my village in Uriri.	E higa 2018, weche ne ok dhi maber ahinya ma chunya ne ogombo ni mondo adog dalawa Uriri.
I remember I posted a photo of my son on social media around that time. 	Anyalo paro ni ne aketo picha mar wuoda e mbuyi e ndalo no.

Which role model gets frustrated and goes home to sulk?	Ngat mane ma ji nigi geno kuome ma piny tamo wang’e ma we gima otimo ma dhi dala?
He says that he realised that they were so many people who admired him and quitting would frustrate more than just himself.	Ne owacho ni bange ne ofwenyo ni nitie ji mang’eny ma mor gi tich ma otimo, omiyo weyo tich ne biro bedo gima rach ok ne en kende to ne biro nego chuny ji ng’eny.

Kembe go ne gin - Orange, Snail Mobile, Etisalat, Axian, Telkom SA, Saudi Telecom Company, Electromecha International Projects, Kandu Global Communications kod Liquid Telecom.
The nine are said to have dropped their interests in the latter stages of the process alleging lack of transparency and the fees the Ethiopian government was asking from them.	Kembe ochiko go ne oweyo manyo tijno bange ka giwacho ni ne onge ler maber kuom chiwo tijno kendo pesa mane Ethopia dwaro bende ne ng’eny.
In the bid requirements, the government wanted the telecommunication companies to build their own network infrastructure such as towers.

Africa's second-most populous country is hoping that the opening of one of the world's last major closed telecoms markets will create millions of online job opportunities.

As the licence fee, the consortium plans to invest up to Sh919.7 billion in infrastructure among other areas, Brook said, adding that it was expected to create between 1 and 1.5 million jobs.

Businesses that previously depended on walk-in traffic or window shopping to make their money have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Thanks to technology and the Internet, online shopping has become the lifeline for many businesses.	En gima ber ni biro mar gik ma ji sani tiyo machalo internet kata sime, ngiewo gik moko e yor sime kata ka ingiyo e internet ema koro jo ohala mang’eny tiyo go.
To avoid contracting coronavirus, many Kenyans have resorted to shopping online and goods are delivered at their doorsteps.	Mondo kik ngato yud Corona, jo Kenya mang’eny koro sani ngiepo mana gi sime kendo gik moko ikelo negi nyaka dho ote gi.
“Shopping patterns changed when Covid came, clients were skeptical about shopping online,” says Brenda Mugambi, an online entrepreneur. 	“Kaka ji ngiewo gik moko kor olokore bang’ biro mar Corona, chon ne ji oluor ng’iepo gi yor sime kata e internet.”  Brenda Mugambi, ma timo ohala e internet ne owacho kamano
She says clients were mostly worried about their safety - whether it was safe to shop for clothes. 	Owacho ni jo ngiepo ne oluor ni ginyalo wito pesa – ka gi wuoro ni bende en gima yot mondo ngato ongiew nanga e yor mbuyi kata internet.
“This was a blow to my business,” Ms Mugambi says. 	“Ma en gima ne omiyo ohanda odhi marach.” Nyadendi Mugambi wacho kamano.
The fashion retailer, who runs an online shop called Starsjoaillere, started her business in 2015.	Ngama uso lewni, ma uso gigene e yor mbuyi, e kambine ma iluongo ni Starsjoaillere, ne ochako ohande e higa 2015.
“When restrictions were eased in the country, I saw a different trend again. I think it is because people could go out again. There was an increase in demand,” she says. 	Kane chike mag Corona odok chien matin e Kenya, ne aneno pogruok kendo. Aparo ni ma ne otimore nikech ji koro ne nyalo wuotho oko kendo. Dwaro mar ngiewo gik moko ne obedore.” Ne owacho kamano.
In addition, many clients work from home. 	Mar ariyo, ji mangeny sani tiyo e odi.
Operating online, she says, has eased the shopping experience for most of her clients as they can easily get what they want from the comfort of their couches.	Timo gik moko e yor mbuyi kata gi sime, Mugambi wacho, sani omiyo joma ngi’ewo gige yoo mayot nikech koro ok ochuno ni nyaka gidhi ire, to ooro negi gima gidwaro e kuonde ma gin tie.
She compares sales from the previous years before Covid: “Business was doing well prior to Covid, there was however an adverse effect when Covid came.”	"Owacho ni ka opimo kaka ohala mare ose bet: ""Ohala ne ber ber dire mane Corona ne pok obiro; bang’e Corona ohala ok ose bet maber ahinya.”"
There was high demand before the pandemic but “our clients have lost jobs, others had pay cuts which in turn affected our revenues.” 	Ne jo ng’iepo ng’eny ka ne Covid pok obiro. “Sani ng’eny joma nyocha ng’iewo kuomwa nyocha owito tijegi; moko kuom gi ne ongad misach gi ma omiyo nwengo marwa ok ber sani.”
“Starsjoaillere ensures customers are satisfied by maintaining proper channels of communication, seamless and speedy delivery of orders and quality products that suit their needs,” adds Mugambi.	“Starsjoaillere temo neno ni joma ng’oepo kuom gi mor ka gi wuoyo kod gi kaka dwarore kendo ooro negi gik ma gidwaro mapiyo.” Mugambi omedo wacho.
And like other digital businesses, online retailers are faced with technological challenges.	Mana kaka ohala mamoko ma bende itimo e yor mbuyi, jogo ma timo ohala e yor mbuyi – online businesss – bende nigi gik ma chando gi.
“We have clients who are still trying to adjust to the digital space. Some also question our authenticity as a business because we do not have a physical location,” Mugambi says.	"Wan gi joma pok ong’iyo gi gik ma itimoe yoo mbuyi – online business. Jo mamoko bende penjo ka ohala ma watimo en adieri nikech wa onge gi kama watime ohala ma inyalo yudwa."", Mugambi wacho kamano."
Many people are also not connected to the internet, therefore their product marketing cannot reach everyone. 	Joma ng’eny bende onge gi simbe mag tudruok e yor mbuyi - internet. Kuom mano, ok ginyal chopo kuom ji mang’eny manyalo ng’iewo gige gi.
Mugambi’s desire to cater for the needs of the modern woman inspired her to start the business. 	Dwaro mar Mugambi ni mondo otim ohala gi mon masani ne omiyo ochako kambi mar timo ohala.
“I saw a gap in the market, it was a challenge to find exciting and affordable shops that would suit the modern woman,” she says.	"Owacho kama, “Ne aneno ka nitie kit ohala ma anyalo timo; kata kamano, ne en gima tek mondo ayud duka ma nengo ne yot kendo man kama ber mane nyalo moro mon masani."""
In 2019, a third-year student pursuing a course in biotechnology started an online shop; Thrift With Dola, with Sh3,000.	E higa mar 2019, nyathi skul mane somo weche mag nonro ne ochako duka ma iuse e mbuyi – online shop ma iluongo ni Thift With Dola mane ochako gi shilling 3,000.

Washed, ironed, folded to ensure the edges pop out, a little perfume if necessary; that is what sets a physical ‘mtumba’ and an online shop apart.

From the same source, the only difference is how it is delivered.	Ka ogol gi kamoro achiel, pok mantiere en kaka ichopo kuom ja ng’iepo.
“My shop deals in official pants, mom jeans, corduroy pants, joggers, cargo pants, tops and blazers,” says Ms Dola.	Dukana uso long' mag tich, longe mine, longe mag kaki, lewni mag tugo, yendni mag nam, lewni ma irwako malo kod koti mag chuo.
She says online selling was convenient as she could not run a full-time business, and therefore saw no need to pay rent for a shop.	Ne owacho ni timo ohala gi sime ne oneno ka ber nikech ne onge gi sa ma onyalo timogo ohala ma dwaro bedo machieng ni kuom mano ne ok oneno gima omiyo onego ochul pesa mar duka ma iuse.
Dola enjoys the rush of getting new products to restock her shop. “I go to the market in the wee hours to ensure I get the best for my customers.	Dola winjo maber ka oringo manyo gik manyien mondo oket e dukane. “Adhi e chiro okinyi mang’ich mondo ayud lweni mabeyo ne jogo ma ng’iewa.”

The first few weeks after Covid were tough for her because of the ban on the importation of second-hand clothes.	Jumbe mokuongo bang’ donjo Corona ne obedo matek  nikech lewni ma ose rwaki ok ne oyie negi donjo Kenya ka.
“People were not buying clothes because they were working from home,” Dola says. Most of her clients, however, were students.	“Ji ne ok ng’iew lewni nikech ne gitiyo ka gin e ot.” Jok mang’eny mane ng’iewe ne gin nyithi skul wetene.
“The purchases were great before Covid, and I moved to online when the pandemic came, and then gradually sales started improving. Going digital was a survival mechanism for me.” 	“Uso ne ber diere mane Corona pok odonjo; ne adhi uso e yor mbuyi sama ne Corona obiro kendo ma ne koro miya ji maber ma ng’iewa. Uso ‘online’ ne atimo mondo ane kaka ne anyalo konyora.”
Dola can tell that her clients are satisfied from the feedback she gets, though the favoured way of shopping is still going to the physical shop and trying out clothes. 	Dola nyalo ngeyo ka jogo ma ng’iewo lepe mor kaluwore gi duko ma oyudo kuom gi. Kata kamano, uso maber to dwaro mana yawo duka ma ji nyalo pimo e lewni ka oromogi.
“Some people don’t know their body sizes, hence they can’t buy online,” she says. 	“Jomoko ok ongeyo lewni ma romogi maber, omiyo ok ginyal ng’iewo e yor mbuyi.” Owacho kamano.

On the Saturday of December 12, 2002, I was part of the sea of humanity that took over the entire of Eastlands from the airport, the Central Business District and Uhuru Park. 	Chieng’ ngeso mar Dwe mar Apar gi Ariyo tarik 12, 2002 ne an achiel kuom jogo mane okawo Eastlands chakre Paw Ndege ma Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, chung town kod Uhuru Park.
There was an aura of change on the country’s top leadership.	Ne nitie lokruok e telo mar kenya.
The current president was the ruling party’s presidential candidate. 	Ker masani ne jachung’ mar riwruok mar siasa matiyo.
The captain of the Opposition had been injured on a road accident days earlier and flown to the UK for specialised treatment. 	Jatend joma ne ochung’ kode ne ohinyore e wanga yoo dala moko ma okalo kendo ne oter loka UK yudo thieth.
And he was returning home for the ballot that would end the 40-year-era of the independence party. 	Kendo ne oduogo dala mar goyo kura mane biro tieko higni 40 ma riwruok mar siasa mane okelo loch e Kenya ose tiyo go.
At that time, nobody worried much that the captain was injured because around him was a robust team.	E seche go, onge ngama ne chunye otho ni jatend joma pinge ne ohinyore nikech ne nitie jogo mane tiyo kode mane loso yore duto.
The climax of the day was a chaotic rally at Uhuru Park late into the evening.	Gima duong’ chieng’ no en romo mane ji dhi bedogo Ohuru Park go odhiambo.
The import of my discussion today is from the speech of the then vice captain, the late Michael Kijana Wamalwa.	Gima omiyo andiko en gima ne jalup jotend jo opposition ma ose nindo Wamwala Kijana owacho chieng’ no.
In his wisdom, he had captured the essence of the moment with these words: “For a great leader to realise his greatness, he must stand on the shoulders of other great leaders.”	Ka ne owuoyo, ne owacho weche gi: “Mondo jatelo ma lich lich ne onenre, nyaka ochung’ kuom goke jowete” ma nyiso ni nyaka konye gi jo-wetene.
This statement sums ups the workings of an economic system. The economic growth that we measure under the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a sum total of several independent variables interacting under the directive of top leadership in the country.	Wach ni owuoyo kuom kaka nwengo piny chalo. Dongruok mar yuto mar piny ma iluongo ni Gross Domestic Product (GDP) en gima nyiso kaka gik moko itimo e piny e bwo jotelo mogik e piny.
Extractive political institutions destroy the genius of economic forces to organise the national endowments, talents and the reward system to generate the desired economic outcomes.	Siasa ma rach ketho gik mangeny e piny ma nyalo miyo piny bed gi dongruok maber.
In the eyes of the late Wamalwa, for an economy to redistribute the national wealth equitably, then policy and political leaders must not only focus on the parts of the economy but also their interactions as a whole. 	Kuom kaka Wamalwa ne neno, mondo yuto mar piny oke e piny maromre, mano dwarore ni chike ma oketi kod jotend siasa nyaka ng’i kuonde ma kelo mwandu ne piny kendo kaka gi romo mondo gi kony piny.
In the current regime, big infrastructure projects have been highlighted as the pillars of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy. 	E sirikal ma sani tiyo, gigo ma oger ma dongo dongo machalo wang’ yore ema iwacho ni e gik madongo ma Piny Owacho otimo ma ibiro par go tich mar Ker Uhuru Kenyatta.
Unfortunately, a legacy is not something that you can do projects towards, but the outcome of several daily activities happening across all government sections and departments.	Kuom hawi marach, gima ngato otimo ma inyal pare go ka ose weyo tich ok en gero gik moko to en gima ji neno ni otimore e bede sirikal ma opogore opogore.
Empirical evidence on economic development identify investments in physical capital, human capital, technological progress, natural resources and property rights, and political stability as drivers of economic growth.	Gik ma nyiso dongruok mar piny nenore e dongruok mar gik ma oger, somo mar dhano, gik manyien ma sani itiyo go, mwandu ma nie loo, neno ni jopiny nigi duol kuom mwandu gi; kod neno ni piny okwe e yor siasa e gik ma miyo piny bedo gi dongruok kor ka yuto mare.
On the other hand, government consumption spending, political and social instability, trade barriers and socialism reduce economic growth.	Kamachielo, pesa ma Piny Owacho tiyo e chulo gik ma ok kel bedruok kaka misara kod marupu ma imiyo jotich, siasa marach kod tungni mar piny, gik ma miyo ohala ok nyal timore maber kod keto ni gik moko duto gin mwandu mar jopiny miyo piny ok nyal dongre maber.
If these are the drivers and inhibitors of growth, how then do we appraise the preoccupation with the legacy projects?	Ka magi e gik ma miyo piny dongore kendo nyalo tamo piny dongruok, ere kaka wanyalo keto e ratili mar pim, wach ma sani ji osiko ka wacho ni gedo mar wanga yore ema ibiro paro go jatelo ma tiyo sani ka oweyo tich?
All sectors matter individually and collectively. 	Migepe duto dwarore ahinya kar gi kendgi kendo kanyakla.
Investments in physical capital include machinery, tools and building that enhance workers productivity.	Dongruok e gik ma igero oriwo masinde, gik ma itiyo go mag lwedo kod gedo mar udi ema miyo jotich medo tiyo matek.
It is unacceptable that the economy is heavily reliant of subsistence farming using equipment of the agrarian era. 	Ok en gima nenore maber ni dongruok mar piny otenore mana e yor pur mar chiemo ma sani pod itimo gi gik machon ma nyaka nene!
This implies that the country has failed to leverage on modern productive capacities to exploit her labour force.	Ma nyiso ni pinywa ok nyal tiyo gi gik ma sani mana mondo mi gi hiny kata gichand jotich.
Human capital refers to the combination of education, health and other non-physical assets of the nation’s workers to enhance their productivity.	Sama sirkal kwano dhano kaka mwandu, gikwano gik ma ng'atno nigo monyalo tiyogo e kelo dongruok ne piny. Gigo oriwo sombe, ngima mar dende, kod nyalo mamoko ma en go ma ok nenre gioko.
Relevant education that impacts economic growth is both formal and informal. 	Somo manyalo konyo e dongruok e yore yuto mag piny oriwo somo mar skul, kod puonjruok ma ng'ato yudo oko mar skul.
