Why secession is not the silver bullet to Nigeria's challenges (II)	(II) Why secession no be di silver bullet to di problem wey Nigeria get (II)
The proponents of Nigeria's break up hinge their reasons on three main pegs; the 1914 amalgamation of the northern and southern protectorates which gave birth to Nigeria, the United Nation's charter on self-determination and allegations of lack of representation and marginalisation in the affairs of the country.	Di pipo wey dey do say make Nigeria break up put am on top three main reason dem; di amalgation of northern and southern protectorate for 1914 wey born Nigeria, di charter of sef determination for inside United Nation plus lack of representation and marginalisation for inside di affairs of di kontri.
The notion that the 1914 amalgamation which secessionist groups say was the foundational move from which most of the current challenges facing the Nigerian nation emanated need to be vigorously challenged and totally debunked.	The mind say na di amalgamation of 1914 wey secessionist group dey say be di foundamental move wey cause plenty inside di current challenge dem wey dey face Nigeria need make dem challenge welwel and debunk am totally.
In this regard, it will benefit us to know that there was an earlier amalgamation in 1906 where the Lagos colony which had been in existence in 1862 was merged with the southern protectorate.	For dis regard, e go benefit us to know say amalgation be don apun earlier for 1906 wia dem merge di Lagos colony wey don dey since 1862 wit southern protectorate.
Like the subsequent 1914 amalgamation which seems to enervate the secessionists, the 1906 amalgamation too was a forced one between unwilling entities which had little or no cultural similarities.	Like di 1914 amalgamation wey follow wey dey enervate di secession pipo dem, di amalgamation wey apun for 1906 too na force dem take do am between entity dem wey no dey willing and dem get little or no cultural similarity.
Pray what did the peoples of the coastal states in the Niger Delta region have culturally and historically with the Yorubas of the Southwest?	Wetin di pipo of costal state for inside Niger Delta region get culturally and historically wit Yoruba pipo of southwest?
What links historically and culturally do the Igbos in the eastern hinterland have with Yorubas for that matter?	Wetin be di historical and cultural link wey di Igbo wey dey for east hinterland get wit Yoruba for dat matter?
As far as can be deduced, the reasons for rejecting the 1914 amalgamation also suffice for the one of 1906 in that they were both a forcible measure against peoples of different historical and cultural backgrounds.	 As far as we fit see am, di reason to take reject di amalgamation of 1914 go reach for di one of 1906 on top say na force dem force di two against pipo wey get different history and culture.
Why then do the secessionists harp only on the 1914 amalgamation to press home their demands neglecting conveniently the 1906 amalgamation?	Why secession pipo dey only tok about di 1914 amalgamation to take press dem demand and dem dey neglect di one wey apun for 1906?
The reasons are simply because for their own narrow political narratives and ends which seek to justify a North versus South secessionist agenda the 1914 amalgamation narrative is more suitable.	Di reason dem dey simple bikos for dem own narrow political tok wey dey try justify North vs South secessionist agenda na di 1914 amalgamation enter am pass.
It would not make good strategy if they also have to cite the 1906 amalgamation which essentially, by import and effect, was similar to the one of 1914.	E no go form beta strategy if dem dey also tok about di amalgamation wey dey essential, by import and effect, and e dey similar to di one wey apun for 1914.
How would it look for instance if Oduduwa secessionists say that the 1906 amalgamation was the reason why Igbos who are of different historical and cultural background have come to  dominate the economic and commercial life of Lagos and as such the Oduduwans are seeking out of this marriage with the Igbos forced on them by the British?	How e go take look for instance if Oduduwa secessionist tok say na bikos of si amalgamation for 1906 di Igbo wey get different history and culture don kom dominate di economic and commercial life inside Lagos and as such di Oduduwa dey seek to komot for di marriage with Igbo wey di British pipo be force on top dem.
Or the Igbos claiming that the 1906 amalgamation was responsible for the skewered nature of economic infrastructure being concentrated in the Southwest which compels them (Igbos) to have to invest in the Lagos economic zone rather than the East at great inconvenience?	or di Igbo dey say na di amalgamation of 1906 kos the bad nature of economic infrastructure wey dem concentrate put for Southwest wey dey carry dem (Igbo) kom invest for Lagos economic zone rather than di East wey go dey convienient pass?
Another fallacy being peddled about the 1914 amalgamation which was purportedly signed by representatives of Nigerian entities, was that it was to expire after a hundred years meaning by 2014.	Anoda falacy wey dem carry concerning di 1914 amalgamation be wey Nigerian entity dem represent sign be say e supoose expire afta hundred years wey mean say na 2014.
That Nigeria is still existing after the expiry date of 2014 is something the secessionists are trying to instigate other Nigerians to agitate against and ensure the end of this expired contraption as they call Nigeria.	Say Nigeria still dey exist afta im expiry date na somethingg wey secessionist dem still dey try to instigate oda Nigeria pipo against and make sure say dem end of dis joinjoin wey don expire as dem dey call am.
Again this is as near a namby pamby narrative as it can get.	Again dis one na near tok wey no get leg.
By 1914 the British had established full and total control of the territory we now call Nigeria as all pre-existing entities such as they were had become subsumed under British rule.	By 1914 di British don get full and total kontrol of di territory wey we dey cal Nigeria now and all di entities as dem be don dey under British rule.
British colonial rule over Nigeria had been unquestionably established which made the amalgamation a purely administrative measure by a colonial overlord for which he did not need the permission of his subjects to carry out.	Dem don establish di British colonial rule on top Nigeria and na dat one make di amalgamation pure administrative measure by colonial overload wey im no need permision from im subject to carry am out.
In this regard the amalgamation could not have been time bound as claimed, and it was not.	For this regard di amalgamation no fit get time to expire as dem dey claim, and e no get.
If ever there was a time for the amalgamation to expire as claimed, it had to be at the end of the British colonial enterprise which at the time was not in the reckoning of the British.	If time ever dey for di amalgamation to take expire as dem dey claim, e suppose be for di end di British colonial enterprise wey be say at di same time no be British go determine am.
If there was a genuine document that contained the terms and condition of the 1914 amalgamation including the signatories representing various pre-existing Nigerian entities as well as clause stating the date of expiry, the onus is on those peddling such as basis for the break-up of Nigeria to present it as proof to us of their justification.	If any genuine document dey wey carry di terms and condition of di 1914 amalgamation wey include pipo wey represent various pre-existing Nigerian entities plus clause wey dey state di clause for di expiry, na di work od di pipo wey dey pray for Nigeria to break up to present am as proof.
In any case, even if such a document existed, with Nigeria's independence in 1960 it ceased to be valid because all entities in Nigeria at the time partook through their elected representatives to discuss and agree on terms to be part of the new country.	For any case, even if such document dey, as Nigeria take get independence for 1960 e no go dey valid again bikos na evri entity for Nigeria dey take part wit di representative wey dem elect to take discuss and agree on top di new kontri.
If an agreement such as being bandied about on the amalgamation existed and if the parties that took part in the independence talk agreed for its retention and inclusion in the independence constitution, it would have become a relevant constitutional and legal case for the secessionists to cite in their agitations.	If di kind agreement wey dem dey carry about di amalgamation dey anywia and if di parti dem wey follow tok about di independence agree to retain am and dem include am inside di independence constitution, e for don bikom relevant constitution and legal case for di secession entity to take cite dem agitation.
On the issue of the UN provision on self-determination as cited by the secessionists for their action, it is important to bear two important points in mind.	On top di issue of di UN provision on sef-determination as dem take cite am for dem secession action, e dey important make dem get two important point for mind.
The UN is not a world government with executive powers to superimpose its will on national governments.	Di UN no be world goment wey get executive power to take stamp dem will on top national goment dem.
A country can invoke the principle of sovereignty to block the implementation of any UN resolution it considers in conflict with its national interests.	Kontri fit use di principle of sovereignty to take block any resolution wey UN make if dem see say e no follow dem national interest.
Although Nigeria is signatory to the UN charter including the provision on self-determination, it can and has the right to block any attempt by any group within it to break-up the country by latching on to that provision.	Although Nigeria follow sign to di UN charter wey di provision of sef-determination follow, e fit and dem get right to block attempt from any group withing wey wan break di kontri if dem use dat provision.
Thus even in the unlikely event of any break-away group in Nigeria securing UN support, Nigeria can within its sovereign rights stand against such a move.	Thus even as e dey unlike say any group break away from Nigeria and UN support am, Nigeria fit use dem sovereign right to stand against such move.
But what is more significant is that although the UN charter provides for self-determination, the UN places a great onus on seeking such to prove their credentials and case comprehensively.	But di thing wey dey more significant be say although di UN charter dey providde sef detrmination, di UN don place great onus to take seek dem credential and case comprehensively.
The process of seeking and eventually getting UN support for a self-determination bid is a very complicated and convoluted one which will take years to come to fruition and may not result in success ultimately.	Di process to take ssek and to eventually get di support of UN for sef-determination bid dey very complicated and covoluted one wey fit take year to set and e still fit no get success at di end.
Those seeking to invoke the UN principle of self-determination for their secessionist bid must first of all prove that they have the mandate of the people of the area they seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through the media or internet.	Those seeking to invoke di UN principle of sef-determination for dia secessionist bid must first of all prove say dem get di mandate of di pipo of di area dey seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through di media or internet. Di pipo wey dey try to evoke UN principle of sef-determination for dem secessionst bid must firts prove say dem dey do wetin pipo for di area wey dem dey represent want wit popular election or referendum no be through media or internet.
They must also show proof that the area seeking to secede has been denied or does not have adequate representation at local, state and national levels of the government of the country.	Dem must to show proof say di area wey want do secession dem don dey deny dem or say dem no get adequate representation for local, state and national level of di goment of di kontri.

Drawing Nigeria back from the brinks	E dey drag Nigeria comeot for up.
The worsening security challenges in the country seem to be getting out of hand.	Security mata wey don spoil for di contri don pass normal.
Many who have so far commented on the issue have painted pictures of hopelessness.	Pipo wey don tok on top di mata don tok say hope nor dey.
To say the least, it has reached a point of despair and as human beings, Nigerians are beginning to doubt if we can survive it and live together once again in a peaceful society.	To tok di wan wey small, e don shoke as persin, Nigeria pipo don dey doubt if we fit survive am and live togeda again as area wey get peace.
Prominent personalities in the country seem to have given up hope which has led to their conclusion that the only way out of the quagmire is for the federal government to seek foreign assistance to be able to tackle the security challenges.	Big big pipo inside di kontri n aim e be like say dem doncomeot mind wey make dem tok say di only way wey tocomet dia palava na for federal goment to find foreign assistance to fit tackle security kasala.
The main opposition political party in the country, the PDP, had also added voice in telling the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government at the centre that Nigeria needs external help to address the festering insecurity in the country.	Di opposition political parti inside di contri, PDP, join mouth put dey tell All Progressives Congress,APC we dey led say Nigeria need outside help to fit tackle security kasala wey don dis.
On his part, the immediate past President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, said President Muhammadu Buhari is overwhelmed by the security challenges, insisting that the federal government needs urgent help and must seek such without wasting time.	As e dey tok im own, di president  of senate wey just pass, Bukola Saraki say president  Muhammadu Buhari don dey taya ontop di security kasala, he de tanda say federal goment need sharpsharp help and make dem find am wit out nor waste time.
He also advised the president to bring together all former presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand.	He also advise  di president  say make ekari all beforebefore president  and heads of state, beforebefore and nownow chief justices, serving and oga dem for National Assembly, beforebefore and nownow oga dem for security agencies, traditional rulers dem wey get experience wey good, oga for private sector dem, development partners, friends of Nigeria for internationalcomemunity wit odas wey fit find solution for dimata wey dey ground.
The ex-senate leader further called on the National Assembly to be more assertive in finding solutions to this issue of insecurity adding that the legislature would not be helping the Buhari administration if they did not become more insistent and decisive in their approach to getting the security crisis tackled immediately.	Dis beforebefore Senate president  still call di National Assembly say make dem find solution to di issue of insecurity as im add say di legislature nor gep dey help dis Buhari administration if dem nor add to dia tanda and decision for dia approach to take see di security palava tackle kiakia.
The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said that Nigeria needs unity to surmount the current security challenges, observing that every nation will go through difficult times and we must unite to succeed.	Di National Leader of di All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, say Nigeria need joinhand to tackle di security shallenge,dey tok say evri contri go pass tru hard time and we must dey united to take succeed.
He added that no president wants a country in chaos, noting that only a concerted and united response will end the numerous security challenges.	He had put say nor president  wan make kontri dey inside palava, e note say na only join hand response fit end dis plenty security kasala.
The best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people.	Di best way na wetin we dey do. Tocome togeda take reduce banditry, to move for unity and fit to  bring a beta Nigeria give pipo.
The welfare of our people is extremely important.	The welfare of awa  pipo dey very important.
And yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times.	And yes, everi contri go pass di hard and difficult time.
How we communicate it to the people, what are the areas to help make it easier for people to bear; those are ideas on how to be able to change the leadership of the country, he explained.	How we take dey tell am to pipo, na which area to take make am easy for pipo; na dem dat area on top how to fit change di leader for di contri; na im he tok.
The truth, however, is that the situation is not yet too bad as is being projected by many stakeholders.	The truth be say, mata neva spoil too spoil as many stakeholders take dey show am.
All hopes are not yet lost.	Hope neva lost finish.
This is not to say that they are not right in their observations and recommendations.	Di one nor be say dem nor dey right for wetin dem see and wetin dem tok.
The situation can be salvaged through collaboration with all stakeholders especially the traditional rulers, religious leaders, synergy among security agencies and the ability of the federal government to provide a level-playing field devoid of ethnic, religious or political interests.	We fit savage dimata wit colabo wit all stakeholders especiallyditraditional rulers dem, religious leaders,joinjoin among security pipo and for federal goment to fit provide solution of tribe abi political interest.
Time has come when the role of traditional rulers in peace keeping must be recognised at all levels.	Time doncome again wey be saydiwork of tradional ruler to make peace must dey recognized for every corner.
They are the custodians of the peoples culture and to some extent, their religion.	Na dem get culture of di pipo fo hand and dia religion to one place.
Traditional rulers, because of their closeness to the people, can play a great role in solving the security challenges if properly mobilised and engaged at local government, state and federal levels.	Traditional rulers becos of say dem dey close to di pipo, fit do big tin to take solve di security gbege if dem gather and follow dem tok wella from local goment go statecomerish federal.
If the traditional rulers at various localities across the country are fully engaged, they can  be the major source of information to the security agencies in terms of identifying any criminal elements lurking around their domains because they know who is who in those areas.	If dem follow traditional ruler dem for every angle for di state yarn wella, dem fit be di koko of wia  secutity pipo go dey get information as to take know criminal tin wey dey dia area because dem sabi dem wey dey di area
There is also the need for security agencies to work together in the fight against insecurity in the land.	E dey needed for security agencies to work together as to take fight insecurity for di land.
There must be a uniting force among them so that at any point one agency must not be away from what the other is doing to avoid not only duplication of duty but also to be on the alert based on information passed across various formations.	To joinhand must dey among dem so dat one side gocomeot ahnd from wetin d other side dey do to avoid to dey two work and to shine eyes put information wey dem sendcome from every angle.
The ugly incident that took place in Maiduguri some days ago where a fighter jet belonging to Nigerian Air Force bombed soldiers going to repel Boko Haram attack is a clear indication of lack of proper information and coordination among the two agencies.	The bad mata hapun for Maiduguri some days ago as fighting jet we be dem Nigeria Airforce own take bomb Nigeria Soldiers wey dem go double cross boko haram na mata we open say beta information and coordination between two agencies nor dey.
All the relevant agencies at the theater of war must be up and doing in information gathering and sharing among themselves to know when, where and how to strike when the enemy approaches or at most to, through such information, nip in the bud plans of such an enemy and prevent them from approaching not to talk of striking.	All di agencies wey be koko for war mata must dey gather tori and spread am to dia sef to take sabi wen, wia  and how enimies wan tackle wit di tori, dia plan go scatter and dem nor go fit attack not to tok of say dem go attack.
Religious leaders through their various organisations such as Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, among others, must also be engaged and enlightened on what to preach to their followers and how to monitor their activities.	Religious leaders tru dia various organisations like Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, and others must dey follow and eye open ontop wetin dem go preach give dia pipo and how to take follow follow dia ways.
These men of God are respected by their followers to the extent that whatever they preach is always swallowed hook and sinker whether such utterances would cause chaos or not.	Dis men of God dem dey dey respect by dia piporish level say anything wey dem tok dem dey swallow go down whether di word go cause gbege or e nor go cause gbege.
They should be properly mobilised and sensitised on the dangers of wrong preaching that could pitch the various religious sects against each other.	Make dem mobilise dem well and sensitise dem on top danger wey dey for wrong preaching wey fit make one religion pipo dey fight di other.
Examples abound where crises have erupted from worship centres due to what the leaders must have told their followers to do, either to retaliate one perceived injustice or the other.	Examples deon dey wey be say wen palava start from place wey dem dey worship becos of wetin leaders dem tell dia pipo say make dem do, whether to fight back because of one injustice or  anoda one.
With proper sensitisation, such would not happen because they must have been educated on what to preach and what not to preach while with their followers.	Witi beta training, dat kai tin nor go hapun becos dem go don train dem ontop wetin dem go preach and wetin dem nor go preach for dia pipo.
It is pertinent to state here, however, that all these would come to nothing if government at all levels fail to provide a level-playing field for peace to reign.	E dey koko to tok am here say all dis nor gocome for vain if goment for every level nor bring wey for peace to dey.
Governments at all levels must strive to provide basic amenities that could engage the youths and take their minds away from crime.	Goment for every level must provide beta beta tins wey youths go dey do to takecomeot their mind from crime.
In trying to solve the security challenges, governments must always ensure that they do not take sides based on ethnic, religious or political differences when addressing issues of security breaches.	As to dey try solve security yawa, goment sef suppose see say dem nor do partial ontop tribe, religion or politics as dem dey try solve security kasala.
Perpetrators of crime must be treated equally according to laws of the land no matter who is involved.	Pipo wey do crime must dey treat disame disame as di law of di land we im dey take be.
A clear example of treating some criminals with kid gloves is the purported arrest of some operators of Bureau De Change in Kano that are allegedly sponsoring activities of Boko Haram insurgents.	Example of treating some criminals wit small hand na di arrest of some pipo wey dey do Bureau De Change for Kano wey dem say dem dey sponsor Boko Haram gbege.
Up till now, their identities have not been revealed which has had a negative effect on the fight against insurgency.	Till now, how dem be never dey open, wey dey get bad way ontop to fight crime.
Government must ensure that they are always in touch with the people especially at the grassroots level for them to know what it is doing about the present situation in the country in order not to allow rumours to thrive.	Goment must see say dem dey always get in touch wit pipo especially for di downdown for dem to sabi wetin bin dey hapun in di contri in oda not to gree for rumour to get power.
With these, Nigeria will surely surmount the security challenge that has bedevilled her for over a decade now with much ease.	Witi dis one, Nigeria go fit bit di security kasala wey dey fight am for over 10 years wit easy.

With the incessant attacks between farmers and herders, state governments, mostly in the South, have resolved to ban open grazing and adopt ranching as an alternative to the age-long practice of herders roaming with their cattle to seek pasture for their herd.

This thing, weykari business sense go, go make livestocks dey chop for a land wey get control for grass and water  ontop contract and to dey plant grass
The practice is not a sedentary mode of grazing since the spacious land allows herders to walk around with their herd to consume grown fodder in a confined area.	This way nor dey function as grazing mode as chance dey for herdsmen to dey waka up and down wit dia cow to dey chop things wey dey any area wey dem go.
However, growing fodder in the grazing area might not be sustainable as lack of rainfall or water to grow it would result in shortage.	But, to dey grow grass for area fit dey easy because rain shortage or water shortage nor go make am do well.

2023: Disquiet in Kwara APC over governors sister	2023: Wahala fo Kwara APC ontop governor sister.
The protracted leadership crisis rocking the Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) took a new twist following calls for the removal of Senator Khairat Gwadabe, a sister to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, from the Membership Registration Appeal Panel set up by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee by some aggrieved founding members the party in the state.	Di teytey leadership palava wey dey hapun for Kwara  State chapter of di All Progressives Congress (APC) wear new cloth as dem some founding members wey dey vex open mouth say make dem comot  Senator Khairat Gwadabe, wey be sister to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, from di Membership Registration Appeal Panel Caretaker Committee wey Governor Mai Mala Buni dey lead.
The call for Khairats removal is coming on the heels of the fierce struggle for the control of the soul of the party in the state between the governor and some aggrieved leaders over the second term ticket for 2023 as the next electioneering campaign beckons.	Di call say make dem remove Khairat dey kom from di wahala of who go dey control di parti for di state between governor and some members wey dey vex ontop second term ticket for 2023 di next electioneering campaign beckons.
The governor and some notable leaders in the party have been at loggerheads since the administration came into power in 2019 in the state over disagreement in his style of leadership.	Di governor and some leader wey get mouth for di parti don dey digger something since dis tenure enta power in 2019 for di state ontop style wey im dey take rule.
But despite some spirited efforts to bring everybody on the same page, according to insiders in the party, the issue appears to have festered, with the latest imbroglio having the potential to consume the party in the race for the top seat come 2023 if the needful is not done by uniting all the forces that collectively defeated the last Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration in the state, led by former Senate President Bukola Saraki.	But ontop all power to take bring everybody togeda under one umbrella, as one insider for di take tok am,dimata dey hot more more wit dis new wahala wey fit chop di parti comot for dis top seat for 2023 if dem nor dom am somtin by joining alldipower wey fall Peoples Democratic parti (PDP) administration for di state, wey former Senate President Bukola Saraki dey lead.
For many members of the aggrieved group, which has the support of top party leaders like the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and his counterpart for transport (state), Gbemisola Saraki, under the factional caretaker chairman, Hon Bashiru Omolaja Bolarinwa (BOB), Khairats inclusion in the membership of the committee was part of a grand plan by the governor to hijack the party machinery in the state in the build-up to the 2023 elections.	Many members of di group wey dey vex wey get di support of big parti leader like di Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and im fellow for transport (state), Gbemisola Saraki, under di factional caretaker chairman, Hon Bashiru Omolaja Bolarinwa (BOB), Khairat wey dem put dey among plan for di governor to hijack parti man-machine for di state as im dey build-up 2023 election.
Some of the top leaders and party supporters in the state, who said they had been disenfranchised from the registration/revalidation process, pointed accusing fingers at the former senator, who they accused of working with the Senator John Danbois committee which headed the last exercise in the state to disenfranchise leaders and members believed to be against the governor.	Some of di top leaders and parti supporters inside di state, wey tok say dem don do dem ojoro ontop registration/revalidation process don accuse di former senator say im bin dey work wit Senator John Danboi committee wey head di last exercise for di state to do ojoro for members wey dem believe say dem dey fight di governor.
Her membership status of the committee, they argued, was to finish the work she started in the state at the national level to remove any obstacle against the second term ticket of the governor and pave the way for his smooth emergence as the partys candidate in the next gubernatorial election.	Im status for di committee, as dem dey drag am, bi to go finish work wey im bin start inside state for national level to clear road for di second term ticket ofdigovernor and open road wey roku for  im to be di parti candidate for di next governor election.
In one of the press releases that have since trailed the issue, a faction of the APC in the state believed to be loyal to the camp of Lai Mohammed and other aggrieved leaders, openly rejected the inclusion of Senator Gwadabe in the 61-member committee.	One of di press release weu yarn d mata small, one faction of di APC for di state believe say dem loyal to di camp of Lai Mohammed and other members wey dey vex, and tok am korokoro say dem nor want make dem add Senator Gwadabe join di 61-member committee.

As di group take talk, One governor sister dey do double mind  work wit didiDanboi committee to kos many wahala and some wuruwuru against watin di parti want for inside Kwara
Their call was echoed by another group believed to be fronting for the minister, Concerned APC Youth Stakeholders, which petitioned the national secretariat of the party as run by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) over the issue, alleging the over 600,000 of its members have been disenfranchised with the connivance of Senator Khairat.	Anoda voice still kom outside wey dem believe say e dey front for di minister, ontop APC Youth Stakeholder, petitioned di national secretariat of di parti wey Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) dey run ontop di issue, say dem don do over 600,000 of dia member ojoro wit di wuruwuru of Senator Khairat.
But shortly after their positions were made known, the governors men and foot soldiers also went to town with their trumpet to drum support for the governor and his sister over the matter.	Sometime after dem tok dia own, some governor men and supporters sef scatter full town dey wit trumpet dey drum and support for di governor and im sister ontop dimata.
It was the publicity secretary of the party, Alhaji Folaranmi Aro, a staunch loyalist of the governor that fired the first salvo thus, Those against the senators inclusion have no basis.	Na di publicity secretary ofdiparty, Alhaji Folaranmi Aro, a strong loyalist of di governor first fire say; pipo wey dey against say dem put di senator nor get tok.
Under the aegis of the Reformist Progressive Forum, the group that supports the governor, in a rejoinder to the statement by the Integrity Group, noted that Senator Gwadabes rejection by the group of political puppets in Kwara is baseless and unfounded.	Under di supporter for di Reformist Progressive Forum, di group wey dey support governor inside one quick reply to di statement of integrity group, tok say di rejection of Senator Gwadabe by group of political small pikin for kwara nor get head and norish tok.
This is unreasonable, illogical and destructive criticism.	Dis one nah mumu criticism wey nor get sense and fit destroy.

When dem go meet am for tori, Saheed Popoola, one of di pipo wey dey loyal wella todiminister and im still be lawmaker for Kwara State House of Assembly from Offa, tell Daily Trust Saturday say im nor dey town.
But a top member of the party and diehard supporter of the minister from Kwara Central said although Alhaji Lai Mohammed and few others registered despite condemnation of the exercise, the action was in demonstration and solidarity with prominent national leaders of the party like Chief Bisi Akande and Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who did but still faulted the process, calling for improvement.

Di action na to demo and to show we dey wit you give big big leaders dem for di parti like Chief Bisi Akande and Bola Ahmed Tinubu wey still tok say di process dey wonkain, make dem do am well.
But on the issue of how this might affect the partys chances in 2023, the top party official said, There is still a long way to go, and many considerations may be laid on the table before then.	But ontopmata on how di tin fit take affect di parti chance for 2023, dem Oga for di parti say; dimata long gan-an and dem fit put manymata ontop table before dat time.

Our workings now na to first get di wayo wey bend di last exercise and to get di hand of National leader dem to do fresh exercise for di state.
For Kunle Suleiman, a lawyer and pioneer chairman of the PDP in the state and an unrepentant apologist of the governor, what is happening is politics and the party will rise above it when the time comes.	For Kunle Suleiman, lawyer wey be pioneer chairman of PDP for di state, wey still be one pesin wey sabi vex  and beg di Governor and go still vex am, watin dey hapun na politics and di parti go grow pass am.
He, however, said their concern was how to deliver good governance, which the governor promised.	Im still tok say dia konsain na  how dem go take make life beta wey di governor promise dem.

Power: Nigerians spend $21bn on generators — Reps	Power: Nigeria pipo dey spend $21bn ontop generators — Reps
The House of Representatives has said the manufacturing sector lost $200 billion while other Nigerians spent $21 billion on generators between 2015 and 2021 on self-generated electricity due to poor electricity supply from the national grid.	Di House of Representatives don tok say pipo wey dey manufacture lost $200 billion as other Nigeria pipo spend $21 billion ontop generators between 2015 and 2021 ontop light wey pesin generate for im sef ontop say light no good for di nation.
The House also called on the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to suspend the proposed increase in electricity tariff.	Di House also don call Di Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to suspend di increase wey dem wan do ontop price for light.
According to Aniekan Umanah who moved the motion at the plenary on Thursday, NERC, working with Distribution Companies (DisCos), increased electricity tariff five times since 2015, the latest being on January1, 2021.	According to Aniekan Umanah wey moved di motion for di plenary for Thursday, NERC, dey work wit Distribution Companies (DisCos), and dem increased electricity tariff five times since 2015, di last one na January1, 2021.
According to him, despite the increases, Nigerians have not enjoyed significant improvement in power generation, but grapple with epileptic supply and poor services from the DisCos.	As e take talk, despite say dem increases, Nigeria pipo neva enjoy beta ontop light, but dey suffer wit on and off light and poor service wey dem DisCos dey give.
Poor services by the DisCos have impacted negatively on the socio-economic growth of the country as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report of 2020 on Nigeria indicated that the manufacturing sector lost over $200bn to inadequate power supply while a whopping $21bn was said to have been spent by Nigerians on generating sets within the period under review.	Poor service wey DisCos pipo dey give don get bad way ontop to grow di economy of di kontri as di International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report for 2020 ontop Nigeria show say di manufacturing sector lost moni wey pass $200bn to light wey nor good and big $21bn n aim dem say Nigeria pipo don spend on top to generator inside dat time wey dem review.

Border reopening discourages hoarding in Katsina markets	Border wey dem open back spoil to dey keepkeep tins for Katsina markets.
The reopening of four land borders by the Federal Government last week has significantly slowed down hoarding activities in Katsina markets, Daily Trust can report.	As di Federal Goment open four land borders last week don slow down keepkeep wey dem dey do for katsina, Daily Trust fit tok.
Prior to the announcement, grain merchants and other businessmen hid under the guise of company agents to buy farm produce in bulk and store to maximise profit in the near future.	Before dom shout am, pipo wey dey sell grains go disquise say dem be agent from company kom buy bigbig farm produce keep to store and get profit later.
According to dealers, despite the restriction on the importation of rice and other food items, merchants were still skeptical to stockpile farm produce as government might change its decision anytime, depending on the circumstance on ground.	As one dealer take tok, despite say dem match leg ontop to dey carry rice and other food enter Nigeria , market pipo still get double mind to keep market ontop say goment  fit change dia mind anytime depend on wetin dey ground.
Alhaji Aminu Hussain, a sorghum merchant, said hoarding of farm produce was not a new business in the markets, but the practice seriously increased with the new agricultural policy of this administration and border closure.	Alhaji Aminu Hussain, wey dey sorghum, say to dey keepkeep market no be new tin for di  market, but e kom go up wit di new  agricultural policy of dis administration and border wey dem close.
Many of us made huge profits on farm produce last year, that is why our people came out early in this harvest period, mopping up the produce; but the recent reopening of land borders has slowed us down.	Many of us chop beta gain ontop farm produce for last year, na why pipo kom out quick dis harvest time to dey buy keep but border wey dem open don slow am down.
The fear among us now is that market price of food items will come down.	The fear wey we get na say price for food go still kom down.
He added that the shortfall of farm output, occasioned by incessant activities of bandits this year, had also motivated the merchants to hoard the produce.	E add join say farm produces wey no kom out plenti bikos of bad way of dem bandit dis year, don give market pipo mind to keepkeep dia market.
Rice, maize and sorghum were the most targeted produce.	Rice, maize and sorghum n aim dem put eye.
Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, a grain dealer at Bakori market, said the announcement of border reopening last week had made an impact on the market price of major food items.	Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, wey dey sell grain for  Bakori market, say as dem shout to open border again  last week don get hand ontop price for major food for di market.
Unlike last year when, by this time, maize was between N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum was N7,000, they are now sold at N14,000 and N13,000 respectively.	E no be like last year we, by dis time, maize dey around N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum dey N7,000, nah N14,000 and N13,000 dem dey sell dem now.
The recent announcement of border reopening has crashed down the price of paddy rice from N14,000 to N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 to N13,000 and maize from N15,500 to N14,000.	Dis shout of open border again wey dem shout down spoil di price of paddy rice from N14,000 go N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 go N13,000 and maize from N15,500 go N14,000.
Tarzana added that most merchants withdrew from bulk purchase of the produce after the announcement, expecting that waivers for the importation of food items would follow anytime soon.	Tarzana add join say many market pipo comot hand to dey buy market bigbig afta dem shout am, get am for mind say di breeze from importation of food go enta anytime.
Our correspondent observed that there are mixed reactions to the land border opening.	Our news pipo see say di land border wey dem open again get many eyes.
Majority of the farmers and merchants prefer the borders to be closed so that they would continue to exploit the numerous value chains of our local agricultural produce.	Plenti of di farmer and market pipo want make di border dey lock so dat dem go dey chop beta for di market wey we dey do for awa  house.
Consumers, on the other hand, welcomed the recent development, in anticipation that government would allow importation of rice and other food items.	Pipo wey dey chop am and some other pipo hapi wit di development and dey expect say goment go allow make dem dey import rice and other food.
But their expectation was shattered by governments reiteration that rice, poultry, cooking oil and other food items remained banned from importation.	But goment kon fall dia hand as im tok say rice, chicken and turkey, oil for cook and other food still dey under ban to dey import.
Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, an agric expert, enjoined the Federal Government not to bow to pressure and give waivers for food importation.	Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, wey be one agric expert, beg di goment make dem sumit give di pressure, allow food to dey enter.
Government has invested a lot in the agricultural sector and we should not allow such huge investment to go down the drain by wavering food importation in this country.	Goment don invest plenti agric sector and make we nor allow dat big investment enta water wit breeze of importation inside dis kontri
It is true that there is palpable fear of food crisis, but we can mitigate that through irrigation farming.	Na true say fear for food crisis don burst evriwia, but we fit reduce am wit farming wit water.
Besides, food importation will only worsen the already economic recession the country is battling with, Muazu said.	To dey import food go make dis economic recession wey dey di kontri worst to tackle, na im Muazu tok
He added that farmers would be seriously affected if government reversed its policy on food sufficiency.	E add join say yawa go gas for farmers dem if goment cancel dia policy ontop to make food plenti.
Why flood-resistant rice is crucial to farmers	Why rice wey flood nor dey important to farmers dem.
The threat to food security in Nigeria as a result of flood will soon be an issue of the past following the release of the FARO 66, a variety of rice that is resistant to flood.	Di threat ontop food for Nigeria bikos of flood go soon be tin of di past as dem release FARO 66, one type of rice wey flood no fit kari.
FARO 66, recently released to rice farming communities by the National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), is a variety that has characteristics and traits that are different from what local farmers are used to.	 FARO 66, wey National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI) release give farming pipo dem be type wey get some tins wey dey different from wetin farmers for here sabi before.
This variety is taller than other ones known to the farmers.	Dis type tall pass other one wey farmers sabi.
With its height, coupled with effective ecological farming management, it is capable of withstanding the stress of flood to a larger extent.	Witi how im tall and some betabeta farming mata, e get power to survive palava of flood wella.
Acceptability of new varieties among farmers has always been a huge challenge, and the introduction of the FARO 66 is no exception.	To kolet new tins among farmers dem dey always be big problem and as dem introduce FARO66 no dey different.
However, when fully embraced by the farmers, the threat to food security in terms of rice production would be reduced.	But if dem farmer kolet am finish, di threat ontop food about rice mata go reduce.
During this years Field Day, organised by the NCRI station in Birnin Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi State, farmers and other stakeholders were introduced to the new variety after a field trip to the institutes demonstration farm in the metropolis.	For dis year field trip wey NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, capital of Kebbi State organise, farmers and dem oga dey introduced to dis new type afta a field trip wey dem do for di institute demonstration farm for di city.
At the demonstration farm, farmers were exposed to FARO 66, which withstood the stress of the recent flood, side by side with the farm of other rice varieties that were washed away by the same flood.	For di demonstration farm, farmers dey expose to FARO66, wey stand gidigba wit flood inside farm and other rice follow di same flood waka.
The two farms, which are situated side by side, revealed the flood disaster tolerant capability of the FARO 66 variety, as despite all stress, it grew to maturity.	Di two farm wey dey near each oda show di power to tanda wit flood wey FARO66 type get, wit all di wahala, e grow and strong.
On the farm of the other rice variety, only the remnants of the rice plant could be seen.	One di farm of other type of rice, na di remaining of rice wey die remain dem see.
Speaking to our correspondent, the head of the NCRI station in Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, said the FARO 66 variety could best resist flood if planted early.	As im follow awa  news pipo talk, di oga for di NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, say di FARO 66 go tanda wit flood if dem quick plant am.
He added that with its hard stem and height, if planted early, the variety could grow to a size that when flood sets in, the plant could resist the condition.	E add join say, im stem wey hard and as e tall, if dem part am quick, di type go don grow reach size wey be say if flood com, di plant nor go gree for am.
He said FARO 66 was released two years ago, but acceptability, as is the case with any new variety, must be gradual, noting that when it becomes widely accepted among farmers, flooding would not be a threat to rice farming any more.	He tok say FARO66 dey release two years ago but to kolet, as for di case wit any new tin, must be small small, tok say, if farmers dem don accept am wella, flood nor go be threat to rice farming again.
According to him, to sensitise the farmers as research on the improved variety progressed, they were carried along to appreciate the processes and results recorded.	As im take tok, to open di eyes of farmers dem as research ontop dis new type dey go front, dem carry dem join bodi to see how e dey go and to record result.
He added that the scientists on the research work were optimistic that if farmers were allowed to appreciate the ability of the plant to withstand flood, acceptance of the new variety among them would not only be fast but also effective.	E add join say science pipo wey dey ontop di research get sense say if dem allow farmers dem to see how dis plant fit take tanda wit flood, no be only to accept am go dey fast, to dey use sef go dey.
Shema, who said lack of sufficient funding had been their major constraint in the research work, called on all stakeholders to invest in the initiative for a better tomorrow as research is not only limited to the development of improved varieties but also created jobs, as well as developed the economy of a nation.	Shema wey tok say as dem nor give dem plenti moni be dia major wahala for di research work, e call stakeholders dem to kom invest ontop dia idea for beta tomorrow as di research no go only develop di new type but e go still create job, and still develop economy for di kontri.
He explained that public lectures were also conducted as part of the day one Field Day activities, saying the essence of introducing public lectures in this years activities is to bring to the notice of stakeholders that research only comes to fruition with sufficient funding	 E explain say dem still do public lecture wey dey among program wey dem do for di first day of di field day wey dem do, e say why dem introduce public lecture join dis year program na to show stakeholders dem say nah if moni wey reach dey n aim research fit get head.
He appealed to well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to inject enough into research.	E beg pipo wey get mouth for Nigeria and organization to kom drop put for research.
The day two was on exhibition and application of technology in farming.	Di two days nah ontop to show how technology take enter farming
When we said flood-tolerant, we are not saying it will not be affected by flood completely.	Wen we tok say he dey tanda wit flood, we no tok say flood no go affect am patapata.
What we are saying is that with its characteristics and desirable trends, it would withstand flood stress to some extent.	Wetin we dey tok be say wit all di tin wey e get for bodi, e go tanda wit flood wahala reach one side.
FARO 66 is tolerant to flood because it is taller than FARO 44 and FARO 52.	FARO 66 go tanda wit flood wahala bikos e tall pass FARO 44 and FARO 52.
Its stem is also harder than the other varieties.	Im stem still hard pass other one.
Ecological management in term of timing for planting is key in resisting flood.	To manage sky as in to plant quickquick na im be di key to tanda wit flood.
Early planting saves a larger proportion of the crop when flood sets in.	To plant quickquick dey save bigbig if flood come.
The moment rain starts, farmers dont need to waste time.	 If rain don starts, farmers dem no need to dey waste time.
They should immediately mobilise for planting.	Dis one go make crop dey strong and hold leg for ground wella before flood go com, as im tok.
This enables the crop to have good vigour and be established well before the flood comes, he stated.	Dem suppose start to dey plant sharpsharp.

Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000) said it had initiated a process through which farmers are linked with commodity buyers as a way of cushioning the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.	Sasakawa Global 2000( SG) don tok say im don find way wey farmers dem fit take colabo wit buyers to see say di wahala wey Covid-19 kos no get power ontop farmers dem
This was disclosed by the organisations research and training officer, Mr Benjamin Shamaki, during a media field tour they organised.	Na dis tin di research and training officer for di organization, Mr Benjamin Shamaki yarn inside one media field tour wey dem do.
According to him, Sasakawa has trained farmers in Kano and Gombe states on effective utilisation of the aggregator facilities, as well as linking farmer associations with prospective buyers to ensure value for their produce, as well as ensure quality of what the farmers are selling during the pandemic period.	As im take talk, Sasakawa don train farmers dem for Kano and Gombe state to dey use di aggregator facilities and to colabo di association of  dem farmer join wit buyer wey go give beta value, give dem wey dem dey plant and to see say wetin dem dey sell Corona time beta wella.

We have encouraged them in the formation of associations, through which we successfully linked them up with buyers of their produce.	We don encourage dem ontop how dem go dey form association, ontop wetin we don successfully colabo dem wit buyers.
They also produced along the value chain of a particular crop, he revealed.	E tok say dem dey don still produce along di value chain of one crop
Similarly, the chairman of Bagwai Farmers Association, Malam Danladi Yahaya Bagwai, said farmers in the area were ready to make good use of the aggregator facilities provided for their agricultural sustainability by SG 2000, adding that they would ensure proper utilisation of the aggregator facilities.

According to him the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed negatively affected farming activities in various states of the federation, including Kano.	As im take tok say Covid-19 don kos bad-market ontop farming for different different state for di kontri, for Kano too.
He added that without Sasakawas intervention, farmers in the area would have been out of business for long.	E add join say if no be for Sasakawa put hand, dem farmer for di area go don forget dia work tey tey.

Poverty of governance and illegal weapons in circulation by  Adefolarin A. Olamilekan 	Governance wey dey poor and illegal weapon for wey dey spread by Adefolarin A. Olamilekan
Governance in Nigeria in recent times especially since the return of civil rule in 1999 increasingly attracts significant attention.	Governance for Nigeria in dis new time especially since di time wey Civil rule don return in 1999 don dey make pipo dey put eye for am.
The attraction is a sad tale of incessant governance failure to address the insecurity situation all over the country.	Di eye wey dem put na bad tori of di goment  wey no gree tackle security mata for di country.
There is a sense in which the current situation makes a case for a wider understanding and recognition of governance, especially with millions of illegal weapon circulation in Nigeria.	E get one sence wey wetin dey hapun make to take sabi governance wella, especially wit plenti plenti illegal weapon dem evriwia for Nigeria .
The nation is not in a palatable one, but concerns over the safety of citizens.	Di nation no dey good at all, but dey concern for di safety of im pipo.
There is an inherent cry for help by the people for a decent existence in terms of security of life and properties.	Pipo dey cry for help for beta security of life and dere properties
As of today, the menace of illegal weapons in circulation in the land is a huge threat to our economic sustenance, unity and co-existence.	As im be today, di way wey weapon dem wey dey illegal dey  plenti evri wia na serious wahala  for economic sustenance, unity and to dey togeda.
It is in this that we discover the nexus between governance and millions of illegal weapons in circulation being a salient matter at this point of our national life.	Na inside all dis kasala wey we take sabi wetin di link wey dey between governance and di illegal weapon wey dey evriwia be,  wey be main mata for dis time of awa  national life.
The current drift and drain of governance in Nigeria in the last two decades have position many Nigerians to be conscientised by the practical experience of poverty of governance.	As Nigeria dey go up and down for di last two decades don make plenti Nigerians sabi wetin be di poverty governance.
Therefore, it is also very imperative for us to point out what governance entails in its simple sense, as well as in the context of this piece.	As e take be like dat, e go beta for us make we sabi wetin governance be for simple sense and wetin in be for inside dis context.
The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition defines governance as an activity of controlling a country or the way in which a country or institution is controlled.	Di Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition tok say governance na di way wey dem dey control one kontri or di way wey one kontri or institution deu dey control.
Thus, governance involves a process of control and controlling activity in a country, including arms and weapons in circulation.	So, governance na di process of control and controlling activity wey dey a kontri join weapon wit im circulation.
Again, governance can be seen as the process whereby constituted official elements wield powers, authority and enact policies concerning public life and economic decision for overall social development.	Again, governance still fit dey look as di process wey dem goment  pipo dey hold power, authority and di way wey dem dey give policy wey pertain to pesin life and economic decision for di beta beta of di pipo.
However, this governance process takes the in-depth application of suitable and influential decision that impacts on the management and distribution of resources that includes revenues, man and materials.	As e be, to dey run di goment  go take make dem use decision wey dey good and wey go get good impact on top di management and di sharing of resources wey include moni, pesin and material.
Moreso, it involves the regulation, implementation and enforcement of desirable policies for target objectives, goals and aspiration through capacity.	 E go involve di regulation, implementation and enforcement for d policy wey pesin want, wey go be for objective wey get target, goals and aspiration through capacity.
Therefore, governance is simply controlling for desirable development result of which, safeguarding life and properties of citizens is key through exact regulations of arms and weapons is vital.	 As e be, governance  na to dey control di development wey pesin want, wey be say,  to protect life and property of kontri pipo tru d regulate of arms and weapon dem be koko.
However, many reasons are being advanced to explain the continued inexorable poverty of governance in Nigeria.	As e be so, e get plenty reason wey explain di poverty wey never stop since for governance for Nigeria .
For instance, poor institutional capacity leads to government failure, so also is the wider inequality, access to justice and fairness that create a burden of oppression and repression.	For example, poor institutional capacity na im cause goment  failure, wey no make  everything  balance in di wey dem dey do justice and fairness, wey cause oppression and jagajaga for mind.
In addition to this, is the ever-rising provocation of nepotism and bigotry, ethnic sentiment that amputate national cohesion in decision making, coupled with negligence on the part of political representatives.	To add join dis one, na as dem dey do ojoro dey help dere family dem, as dem dey selfish, ethnic partial wey don cut to dey togeda ontop decision making troway, and as di political representative no dey too do dia work.
The recent alarm raised by the Chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC) and former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar at a dialogue session of the committee with stakeholders at Transcorp Hilton in Abuja that over 6 million illegal weapons are currently traced to civilians, many of whom are jobless, hungry and angry.	Di mata wey di Chairman for di National peace Committee (NPC) and d former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar tok for Transcorp Hilton for Abuja say e pass 6 million illegal weapon wey dem fit trace to di kontri pipo, many of dem no get work and dem dey hungry and angry.
The number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.	Di nomba of di small small weapon wey dey Nigeria for di hand of kontri pipo wey no dey military reach 6,145,000 and armed forces and law enforcement pipo count dia own to be 586,000 weapon.
He went further to reveal the deplorable insecurity challenge in the country.	E still tok go front about di sekuriti problem wey dey di kontri.
Informing the nation that 80,000 Nigerians have died in recent months with close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) spreading across the country all because of growing dire insecurity and illegal weapons circulation in the country.	E tell all di nation say na 80,000 Nigeria pipo don die for recent month and like three million pipo  be Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) evriwia for di kontri bikos say sekuriti problem dey plenti and illegal weapon dem waka evriwia for di country.
He also added by saying that the security forces are not only overstretched but are under-funded, asserting that they can perform better with more sophisticated weapons, equipment and with accountable funding provided.	E kon tok say di sekuriti forces no just dey over work but dem no get moni, and e tok say dem fit do beta if dem give dem beta weapon, equipment and make dem give dem moni wey go dey accountable.
The concern raised by the former head of state and the chairman of National Peace Committee (NPC) stands a reason to take governance seriously over the carnage in the land.	As di forma head of state and di chairman for National Peace Committee (NPC) take shuk mouth for di mata, e don show say we suppose take governance serious ontop plenty die-die tins for di kontri.
Incidentally, this has shown that even those who exercise power and authority are living in fear.	Wela, e don show say pipo  wey even dey power and authority dey live for inside fear.
It is in this context that they must pay heed to the cry of the people for help by taming the illegal weapon circulation.	For dis side dem suppose hear cry for help of d pipo make dem try reduce as illegal weapon dem waka evriwia.
Moreover, a recent report on arms proliferation in Africa tagged	For onetime dem tok say na for Africa weapon dey increase pass.
Small Arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration in Nigeria highlighted that arms proliferation gave rise to armed groups and also led to the displacement of several Nigerians.	Small arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration for Nigeria, tok say na as weapon too dey increase na im make bring gunpipo, n aim still kos di scatascata of many Nigeria pipo.
Conversely, the report stated that the proliferation of arms in Southern Nigeria has led to increasing violence in the region, such as communal clashes, cultism, kidnappings, ethnic and religious clashes, and militancy in the Niger Delta.	Di report tok say na as weapon dey plenti for  Southern Nigeria n aim make kasala plenti for area like village wahala, cult, kidnapping, tribe and religion gbege,  and militancy for di Niger Delta.
In the same vein, the report had it that in the Northern region, due to existing state corruption, large tracts of ungoverned spaces, and mass unemployment has been responsible for rising criminality and violence in the region.	And na d same way di report tok say for Northern Nigeria side, as per say corruption don plenti for dat side, dem get plenti land wey no get pesin wey dey rule am, and dem no too get work and na dis tins don make criminal and wahala mani for dia side.
The report opines that the aforementioned succeeded because of the proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).	Di report tok say wetin we tok before hapun bikos say Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) dey increase.
The situation calls to question, the feasibility of the National Task Force on Small Arms and Light Weapon.	Di mata dey question di feasibility of di National Task Force on top Small Arms and Light Weapons.
Hence, we must chart the way forward, even though it looks blink and insurmountable.	So, we must to find di way to dey go front, even say e no dey clear and we no fit settle am.
We must rise to the occasion to tackle illegal weapon circulation in the country with the entire government structure confronting the menace headlong at federal, state and local government.	We suppose face di mata and tackle as di illegal weapon dey dey evriwia for di kontri wit all di goment  structure wey dey tackle di mata for di federal, state and local goment  level.
Equally, the National Task force on Small Arms and Light Weapon and office of the National Security Adviser to the President (ONSA) must re-double their efforts in the fight against illegal arms proliferation through preventive and repressive engagement.	And as e be, di National Task Force for Small Arms and Light weapons  and di office of di National Sekuriti Adviser for di President (ONSA) must tight moremore to tackle di illegal arm wey don plenty wit to disturb and to stop am.
Succinctly, appropriate people-centred governance programmes and security policies are needed to incorporate not just community policing but individuals and group policing networks of intelligence sharing.	As e kon be like dis, we need program wey go teach how dem dey carry pipo for mind for governance and di sekuriti policy dey needed no be only community policing but policing for individual and group to dey share intelligence.
Essentially, transparency, accountability and responsibility are the key watch of governance, without this, eliminating illegal weapons in circulation is tantamount to fruitless exercise.	Di main tin na transparency, accountability and responsibility for beta governance, if dem dey, we no go fit comot all di illegal weapon wet dey evriwia.
