Taming Nigerias oil spillage and gas flaring scourge	To tame Nigeria oil spillage and gas flarin scourge
By Jerome-Mario Utomi	E kom from Jerome Mario-Utami
The recent news report that the Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) discharged some 213 barrels of crude oil into the Ikarama community in Bayelsa, has again brought to our consciousness that though Nigeria prides itself as the giant of Africa and the most populous black nation in the world, yet, it is still riddled with third world challenges.	Di recent news report say Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line wey Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) dey operate discharge 213 barrel crude oil for Ikarama community for Bayelsa don reach awa side say though Nigeria wey been dey proud say dey be giant of Africa and di black kontri wey get pipo pass for di world stil dey get plenti third world kasala
Essentially, while clarifying that an estimated 1.34 hectares of land was polluted by the leakage, which followed a rupture on the pipeline, SPDC among other things confirmed that probe into the incident had been concluded, noting that out of the 213 barrels of SPDCs bonny light crude stream leak, some 110 barrels are recoverable from the ongoing recovery exercise at the site, leaving an estimated spilled volume at 109.12 barrels.	As dem dey clarify say na like 1.34 hectare land dem pollute wit di leakage wey rupture for di pipeline follow, SPDC confirm say dey finish di investigation of di incident, dey tok say out of 213 of SPDC bonny light crude leak, na like 110 barrel dem see recover for di recovery exercise wey dem dey do for di site, e kom remain 109.12 barrel of di volume wey spill.
Admittedly, these claims by the Dutch oil giant are verifiable facts but may not be the only explanation.	Admittedly, wetin Dutch oil giant claim na fact wey dem fit verify but e fit no be di only explanation
Their clarification notwithstanding, there are indeed reasons that qualify such happening in Nigerias oil and gas industry as a reality that demands holistic analysis.	Notwitstandin dia clarification,reasons dey wey qualify dis kind apunin for Nigeria oil and gas industry as reality wey dey suppose analyse generally
Lets begin with reality.	Make we start wit reality
Aside from the awareness that spillage occurs, communal rights to a clean environment and access to clean water supplies are violated in such cases and the oil industry, by its admission, has abandoned thousands of polluted sites in the region, which needs to be identified and studied in details while communities adversely affected are adequately compensated for their losses, this latest spill is coming weeks after a similar one from a ruptured pipeline facility managed by one of the International Oil Companies operating in the Niger Delta that reportedly ravaged Benikrukru and adjourning communities in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.	Aside from di awareness say spillage dey happen, communal right for environment wey clean and access for clean water supply na hin dey don violate for dat kind case, wit dia admission, dey don abandon thousands of site wey dey don pollute for di region, wey dem nid identify and study for detail as dey compensate di community wey e affect well for dia loss wella, dis lastest spill apun weeks afta one wey resemble am for one pipeline facility wey rupture wey one International Oil company wey dey  operate for Niger Delta dey manage, wey dem report say destroy Benikrukru and commuinty wey dey around am for Warri South-west local goment Area for Delta state.
And another in the early hours of Sunday, March 14, 2021, at Polobubo/Opuama Communities, Warri North Local Government Area of the state, could settle.	And anoda one for early momo on Sunday, March 14,2021 for Polubobu / Opuama, Warri North local Goment Area for di state, go fit settle.
Such litany of spillages also include but not limited to, namely; the historic large scale spillages in places such as the Ogoni Land, Rivers State and the Erovie community in Ozoro, Isoko North Local Government of Delta State 1990s, both in the Nigerias South South geopolitical zones, of which their negative impacts linger.	Dis kind big scale set of spillage also include but e no dey limited to; di big spillage wey dey history for place like Ogini land, Rivers State and Erovie community for Ozoro, Isoko North Local Goment for Delta state for 1990s, di two for Nigeria south south zone and negative impact still dey der.
Are these the only explanations/examples?	Shey na di only explanation /example dem be dis?
The answer is a definite	Di answer na ogbonge
no, as there exist yet	no, as oda ones dey
other critical reasons/concerns why we should view the situation as a crisis.	Oda critical reason / concern dem why we suppose see di situation as crisis.
First and very fundamental is the inability of Nigeria and Nigerians to appreciate and treat crude oil spillage and environmental pollution resulting from exploration/crude oil production related activities as a national calamity.	Di first and veri important na di inability of Nigeria and hin pipo to appreciate and treat activity wey relate to crude oil spillage and environment pollution wey dey kom from exploration/crude oil production as national calamity
The second is the stunning consciousness that gas flaring/environmental degradation resulting from crude oil prospecting/production-related activities in the country is under reported.	Di second na di stunnin conciousness wey gas flarin/ environment degradation dey apun bikos of activities wey dey related to crude oil prospectin/ production for di kontri dey under-reported.
This second concern stems from a recent comment, which according to media report was credited to the Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, who stated that findings by his agency showed that an average of five oil spills was recorded daily in Nigeria.	Dis second concern dey kom from one recent comment, wey be say from media report na from di Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, wey tok say wetin hin agency find show say average of five oil spills na hin Nigeria dey record evriday.
Musa, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, said, In 2018 we had about 600 oil spill incidents and in 2019, we had over 700 oil spill-impacted sites across the country.	Musa, wey follow journalists tok for Abuja, tok say for 2018, we get 600 oil spill incident and for 2019, we get about 700 oil spill-impacted site actross di kontri.
This wakeful comment becomes even more relevant to the present discourse when one remembers that Nigeria according to reports is dotted with about 139 gas flare locations spread across the Niger Delta both in onshore and offshore oil fields where gas which constitutes about 11 percent of the total gas produced are flared.	Dis comment wey dey open brain dey more important for wetin we dey discourse if pesin remember say Nigeria accordin to report don get about 139 place wey gas don flare across Niger Delta both for di oil fields wey dey water and di one wey no dey, wer gas wey dey flare dey reach 11% of evrithin wey dem dey produce.
More than anything else, it brings to mind the questions as to; what exactly impedes the development of the petroleum sector and Niger Delta region?	Pass anything, na di question dem wey e bring kom mind be; wetin dey stop di development of petroleum sector and Niger Delta region
Are there no legislative works?	Shey Legislative work no dey?
Why is such a legislative framework not providing a strong source of remedy for individuals and communities negatively affected by oil exploration and production in the coastal communities?	Why dis kind legislative framework no dey provide strong source of solution for pipo and community wey oil exploration and production affect badly for coastal comminity dem?
If these frameworks exist, why is it not effective and enforceable?	If dis framework dey, why e no dey work or make dem do am?
Is the framework as comprehensive as a legal solution to the issues of oil-related violations?	Shey di framework get evrithin  like legal solution for di issues of violations wey relate to oil?
Why has the nation not learned a valid lesson from the Dutch government where all operators are required to restore their areas of operation back to how nature intended?	Why di nation neva learn serious lesson from Dutch goment wia all di pipo wey dey operate must restore wia dem dey operate back to how dey meet am?
Regardless of what others may say, the truth is that if as a nation we are desirous of developing policies that will engineer prosperity in the oil and gas sectors while saving the people of the region, then, we must be ready to locate the strategic triangles that hold the key to success.	Regardless of wetin oda pipo tok, di truth be say if all of us get am for mind to develop policy wey go bring prosperity for oil and gas sector, while we go still save di pipo for di region, we ready to find di strategic triangles wey hold di key to success for hand.
Separate from the fact that success requires a careful analysis of the various kinds of knowledge needed to make innovation possible, the need for the nation to straddle the middle ground has become necessary since both the ministry and sector have for a very long time manifested signs of an institution with neither primed nor positioned potentials.	Apart from di fact say success need make dem analyse am wit care, of di different kind of knowledge wey dem need to make innovation possible, e don necessary for di nation make dem hold di middle ground since both di ministry and sector don dey manifest signs for long time now say dem go be institution wey no get potential wey strong.
And as we know, any organisation, be it private or public that fails to search for its potentials leaves its survival to chance.	And as we know, any organization, whether private or public wey no gree search for hin potential, hin survival na by chance.
At this instant, looking at both the operational templates of the ministry and how the up, mid and the downstream players of the petroleum industry have become reputed for non-compliance to set rules,  it will not be a wrong assertion to conclude that the critical factors fueling crude oil spillage/gas flaring can be divided into the following; the existence of  multiple but obsolete regulatory framework, which characterises the oil and gas exploration and production in Nigeria; federal governments failure to get the nations refineries back to full refining capacity; the petroleum ministrys inability to get committed  to making International Oil Companies(IOCs) adhere strictly to the international best practices as it relates to their operational environment; And finally, non-existence of clear responsibility/work details and action plans for agencies and parastatals functioning under the ministry.	For dis level, if we luk di operational template of di ministry, and how dey don know say di up, mid and down stream players of di petroleum industry say dem no dey follow rules, e no go dey wrong make pesin conclude say dem fit divide di serious reasons wey dey kos Crude oil spillage/gas flarin to; regulatory framework wey plenti wey no dey work, oil and gas exploration and production for Nigeria dey; federal goment failure to make di kontri refineries dey work to dia full capacity back ; petroleum ministry inability to make International Oil Companies dey follow di international best practices as e relate to di environment wey dem dey work; Di last one, clear responsibility/work details wey no dey and action plans for agencies and parastatals wey dey function under di ministry.

To explain these points beginning with the first challenge, it is worth commenting that the business of crude oil exploration and issues of oil production in the country is regulated by multiple but very weak laws and Acts of which most of these laws not only complicate enforcement but are curiously too old-fashioned for the changing demands of time thereby, creating loopholes for operators, especially the International Oil Companies (IOC) to exploit both the government and host communities.

Interrogating IPOBs Emma Powerful threat to spill blood	IPOB Emma Powerful don threaten pipo say he go spill blood.
IPOB leader has threatened to turn the country to a zone riddled with bloodbath for people that don't see reason with him	IPOB leader don threaten pipo say hin go dey kil pipo wey no reason wit am
The threat to murder in cold-blood by one Emma Powerful, media and publicity secretary of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) of any Igbo who neglects his warning is certainly going too far and should not be ignored, except we have finally descended into anarchy, where the powerful  as the little fascist, Mr. Emma Powerful as he called himself  can drag people out for merely disagreeing with him or his organization and have them dispatched to their ancestor as he boasted.	Emma Powerful wey be media and publicity secretary for IPOB threat to dey kil any Igbo pesin wey no follow hin warning don dey too serious, and dey no suppose ignore am except say we no get goment, wer small small fascist like Mr Emma Powerful as he call himsef go dey tok say hin go dey drag pipo kom out, dey send dem go meet Baba God as he tok bikos dey no follow am or hin organization.
He did not seem to boast empty; as the mayhem that is enveloping the South East region of Nigeria is obviously orchestrated.	Di mouth wey hin dey run no be play; as e be say di kasala for Nigeria South-east show say na plan dey plan am.
Bereft of the understandingg of the simple Igbo leadership etiquette, where a leader is Onye-oje ozi,or servant of his people who builds consensus through extensive consultation, the Emma Powerful who prefer a thuggish title of Onye-ike,whose basic instrument is coercion, intimidation and now threat to murder the same Ndigbo, who he claim to champion their cause.	As he no understand how simple Igbo leadership dey be, wey be say dia leader na Onye-oje ozi or servant of hin pipo, wey make di pipo agree wit am afta he don consult plenti pipo, Emma Powerful wey prefer one thug title, Onye-ike, wey be say na to dey force dem, make dem fear am and now he dey threaten to kil di same Ndigbo wey he say he dey fight for.
For a man so intolerant and wired to effortlessly shed blood to advance his cause, the question is who would really want to live in a Cave Republic run by bloody thugs.	For man wey be say he no dey tolarate, wey be say to kil pipo take push hin cause no be kasala, di question be say who go wan stay tru tru for Cave Republic wey be say na thug dey run am
The historical Biafra was not a choice made by Ndigbo; it was rather the only available option forced on Ndigbo at the time at a particular time in history, which they braved out with enormous heroism and sacrifice to defend and uphold.	Di Biafra wey pipo know for history no be Ndigbo choice; Na di only choice wey dem force Ndigbo do be dat for dat time, wey dem face bravely wit plenti courage and sacrifice so dem go fit defend and uphold
Biafra was not so much rebellion as it was a resistance to affirm the right of a people   not only to exist but to live in dignity.	Biafra no too oppose authority reach how dey try make di pipo right dey valid, no be say make dem just exist, but na to live wit dignity.
The historical Biafra was a line of safety drawn so that all of the Igbo people  then, brutally persecuted  who crossed into, can live in relative safety.	Di Biafra wey dey history na like safety precaution for all Igbo pipo wey suppose don too suffer dat time fit kom, place wey dey fit stay safely.
The declaration and the struggle of the historical Biafra was not a show piece or a profit-making enterprise for which the current purveyors are curiously engaged in.	Di declaration and di struggle of di old Biafra no be show or avenue to make moni wey di pipo wey dey lead am dey do pass now.
Prior to the declaration of Biafra in 1967, the Eastern consultative assembly, a formidable representative and consultative body of all shades of opinions in the eastern region, given the circumstances of the time unanimously agreed and gave their authority to the declaration.	Before dem declare Biafra for 1967, Eastern Consultative assembly, one group wey dey represent, still dey advice for all di opinion wey pipo get for east, bikos of wetin dey apun gree say make dem make di declaration wit dia authority.
And that was why the war to defend the young republic was a widely shared enterprise of Ndigbo and even other non-Igbo ethnic nationalities in the region, who made unforgettable sacrifices.	Na di reason wey make di whole Ndigbo and oda tribe wey no be Igbo, wey sacrifice, wey dem no fit forget gree protect di republic wey still small
Even as the war ended, with the collapse of Biafra, and national reconciliation, Ndigbo returned to project Nigeria without malice and with considerable determination and courage, to enable it work.	As di war dey end sef, wey Biafra don fall, wey evribodi don settle, Ndigbo go back go protect Nigeria, wit clean mind, strong determination and courage, so e go fit work,
The context of contemporary Nigerias crises and deepening fissures is on account of a neo-capitalist state hobbled by the backwardness and fetter of the productive forces, shackled and unable to reproduce the material basis for its existence.	Di context of new Nigeria kasala and disagreement for dia point of view wey dey deep na bikos of one neo-capitalist state wey dey go backward, and di chain of di productive forces, wey dem chain, wey no fit produce di material of hin existence again.
As the contemporary Nigerias state grows hollow and enters a melting point of atrophy and lethargy, the basic units consisting of ethnic nationalities and other civic, cultural and religious entities struggle for a space of self-preservation, expression and recreation.	As di new Nigeria kasala dey grow, wey e no dey progress and e slow, di simple tins like tribe, culture and religion dey struggle to preserve, express and recreate diasef.
In the overall, it is easier to brandish a secessionist flag, without an iota of understandingg of the critical socio-economic infrastructure on which a viable state can be constructed.	ova-all, e dey easy to carry retirement flag, wen dey no understand how socio-economic infrastructure dey important if dey wan build kontri wey go survive.
Africas newest state, South Sudan is still tragically in the intensive care unit, leaving the larger number of her population in worse condition than the earlier condition before a brand new state was created.	South Sudan wey be Africa last born still dey breastfeed as dia condition now worse pass dia former condition.
There is nothing to indicate that the current loud canvasser of Biafra has any insight into what a state establishment and construction is all about.	Notin show say Biafra current leader wey like to dey make noise know anythin about how dem dey build or create kontri
Even as the independent state, the yearn for are not in insight, the authoritarian and fascist streak of its purveyors like the threat of the Emma powerful that whoever disagrees with him would be dispatched to meet his ancestors are already evident.	Even if dem dey independent, to built state no dey di real deal, to dey command pipo witout respect , make di fascist leaders like Emma Powerful wey dey threaten to kil pipo don show already.
Ndigbo is quite sophisticated to be led by thugs and touts, who lack the simple understandingg that Igbo political culture and framework is basically consultative.	Ndigbo too posh to get leaders wey be thug and tout, wey no understand say Igbo political culture and framework na to dey consult elders.

Yet, over the past couple of years, there has been unnecessary controversy over which charitable deed between sponsoring the broadcast of Quranic tafseer and charitable mass feeding for the needy is more worthwhile in Ramadan.	ova many many years, dia bin don dey unnecessary controversy ova say wich charitable work better pass between make dem dey suponsor broadcast Quranic tafseer abi make dem dey do charitable mass feeding of di needy for Ramadan.
As in other Muslim societies, Ramadan usually inspires a phenomenal rise in individual and societal spirituality in Nigeria where many wealthy individuals sponsor live or recorded broadcasts of Quranic tafseer by various Ulama.	As e dey go for oda Muslim societies, Ramadan dey always inspire a phenomenal risefor individual and for societal spirituality for Nigeria wer plenty  wealthy pipo dey sponsorlive or recorded broadcast for Quranic tafseer by different Ulama
Many others also spend more on charitable mass feeding for the poor.	Many oda pipo dey spend more on top charitable feeding of di poor.
However, while almost, if not all, who sponsor the broadcast of tafseer do also spend on charitable feeding, not all who spend on charitable feeding sponsor the broadcast of tafseer.	Howeva, while almost, if no be all, who dey sponsor di broadcast tafseerb dey spend for di charitable feeding too, no be all wey dey spend for charitable feeding dey suponsor di broadcast of tafseer.
During Ramadan in a typical northern Nigerian city, television and radio stations make a killing with the sale of airtime for tafseer and other religious lectures sponsored by individuals, firms and groups.	Ramadan period for northern Nigeria, television and radio stations dey make profit wit di sale of airtime for tafseer and oda religious lectures wey individual, firms and groups sponsor
From the sheer number of sponsored broadcasts of tafseer and other religious lectures on the more than 10 radio stations in Kano, for instance, one may wonder whether they do other programmes in Ramadan.	from di kin number of sponsor broadcast of tafseer an dem oda religious lecture wey dey for like 10 radio stations for Kano, for example, one fit begin dey wonda weda dem dey do oda programme for Ramadam period.
Now, while sponsoring tafseer broadcast is absolutely worthwhile, especially during Ramadan, the amount of resources spent in this regard might be disproportionate considering the desperate need for food that the largely hunger-stricken audiences are languishing in.	E good say dem dey sponsor tafseer broadcast, especially for Ramadan, di amount wey dem dey spend for dis regard be like say im dey imbalance if we consider di kin hunger wey dey wire di needy
After all, given the choice, they would certainly choose food handouts over such sponsored broadcasts as public tafseer sessions are everywhere during Ramadan for one to choose which to attend.	afta all, if dem get chance to choose, dem go certainly choose food hangout ova dat kin sponsored broadcast, as e don be say public tafseer session dey evriwia for Ramadan wey persin fit choose wich to attend.
Besides, looking at the underlying dynamics and politics of sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, one cannot rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interests as some of the motives behind sponsoring the broadcast of some tafseer and other religious lectures.	Besides, di kin underlying dynamics and politics wey dey for sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, persin no fit rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interest wey be di main motives for di sponsor of tafseer and dem oda religious lectures.
Interestingly, while some sponsors compete in sponsoring the broadcast of tafseer by some prominent Ulama, some Ulama sponsor the broadcast of their own tafseer in the absence of a willing sponsor; others even beg for sponsors to sponsor theirs.	Wetin dey interesting be say, while some sponsor dey compete for who go sponsor di broadcast of tafseer wey some prominent Ulama dey anchor, some of di Ulama dey sponsor dia own broadcast tafseer even if dem no see persin wey wan sponsor;  odas even dey beg for sponsor wey go sponsor dia programme.
Also, as the contents of some tafseer and other religious lectures feature some serious flaws, sponsoring their broadcast is a gross misplacement of priority.	Also, di content wey some tafseer and oda religious lectures dey feature get some serious flaws, to dey sponsor dis kin broadcast nah big misplacement of priority
Equally interesting, others sponsor the broadcast of Adhan (Kiran Sallah) in a city like Kano	anoda thing wey dey interesting be say, some dey sponsor di broadcast of Adhan ( Kiran sallah) for inside city like Kano.
where, thanks to the sheer proliferation of mosques, regular Adhan reaches every nook and cranny.	wia, thank you to sheer wey dey increase for Mosques, regular Adhan don dey reach evri corner
Anyway, while Ikhlas is always the most fundamental yardstick that determines the worthwhileness or otherwise of both charitable feeding and the sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer broadcast, striking an appropriate balance between the two guarantees the perfect outcome.	Anyway, Ikhlas bin di ogbonge yardstick way dey determine if weda charitable feeding and di sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer  broadcast dey worthy or not, striking appropriate balance between di two go give better outkom.
Because as much as Ramadan is the month of the Quran when Muslims are expected to be particularly committed to it in terms of reading, learning its meanings and living accordingly,	Even though say Ramadan be di month of di Quran wey be say Muslims suppose dey commited in terms of reading, learning wetin im mean and to dey live dia lives accordingly
it's equally the month of generous charity when Muslims, particularly the wealthy, are expected to do much more in terms of charitable works especially mass feeding.	Di month nah di month of generous charity wey be say Muslims, particularly di ones wey dey wealthy suppose dey do charity work, especially mass feeding.
However, while that's simply the bottom line, which also explains why the controversy is absolutely unnecessary, the so-called liberal Muslims have blown it out of proportion.	Howeva, while dat one com be di bottom line, wich explain why di controversy no dey necessary, di Liberal Musilims don over do am
Capitalizing on public frustration amid the unbearable hunger ravaging the largest segment of the society, they question the worthwhileness and relevance of sponsoring the broadcast of Ramadan tafseer under the prevailing circumstances.	capitalizing on top public frustration wey dey inside di hunger wey dey wire di society, dem dey kwesion weda di sponsoring of di broadcast Ramadan tafseer dey worthy or relevance for under dis kin condition wey we dey find ourselves.
Also, feigning empathy and concern, they address the two charitable works as though mutually exclusive and thus people should choose between them.	As dem don pretend show empathy and concern, dey tok say di two charity work be di same and make pipo choose between dem.
Unsurprisingly, and under the pressure of the hard conditions, many people, including many otherwise discerning folks, fell for that propaganda not realising its context, which is the raging face-off between the so-called liberal Muslims, on the one hand, who are hell-bent on undermining Islamic and moral values in the society, and the wholehearted Muslims, on the other, especially the Ulama among them who are committed to encouraging people to never neglect their religious commitments in pursuit of their legitimate worldly pursuits.	Under di hard condition wey pipo dey, e no surprise to dey see many pipo, including di ones wey fit discern, fall for di propaganda wey dem no know e context, nah im be di raging face-off wey dey between di Liberal Muslims, for anoda side, dem bin wan undermine Islamic and moral values for di society by force, togada with di
Also, contrary to their claim, such so-called liberal Muslims aren't actually disturbed by the plight of the vulnerable, which explains why they never urge those spending huge resources on other things, no matter how absolutely worthless, to divert the resources to charitable courses.	Also, contrary to wetin dem claim, di Liberal Muslims no dey disturb by di kin wahala wey dey for di vulnerable, dis don explain why dem neva urge those wey dey spend huge resources on top oda things, no mater how worthless im be, make dem divert di resources to charitable course.
Likewise, they never urge that the massive amounts of resources their elite role models spend on maintaining their extravagant lifestyles should be diverted to the feeding of the poor or sheltering them.	Dem neva urge dat di kin massive amounts of  resources dia elite role spend on top say dey wan maintain dia big lifestyles suppose dey diverted for di feeding of di poor or to take give dem shelter
Instead, their conscience comes alive only when the resources are meant for, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daawah etc.	Instead, dia conscience go kom alive wen resources dey for only, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daourh

He however said his firm built the road for N200 million to connect the 600 unit Perfect Estate in the area.	He tok say na hin firm build di road for #200 million to connect di 600 unit Perfect Estate wey  dey for di area

The housing developer lamented the high cost of providing infrastructure by the private sector to aid urban development.	Di developer wey dey for housing lament say, di money for di infrastructure wey kom from di private sectors to kom gain urban development.

Without a good access road, you discover that marketing an estate becomes a big challenge.	if we no get better road you go see say to advertise di estate go kom bi a big kasala

Seven issues that will make or mar Nigeria to 2023.	Na  seven things go make or destroy Nigeria for 2023.
Buffeted by deep-seated existential challenges which the leadership has proved incapable of tackling, many are coming to the belief that Nigerias future survival as a country is not certain.	Buffeted by deep – seated existence challenge wey di leaders no fit tackle, many people don belief say di future survival of Nigeria no dey sure.
The signs certainly are there clearly manifested in all facets of life; large swathes of the country are now under the control of non-state actors, a shrinking economy characterised rising inflation and poverty, and social sectors in free falling collapse.	Di sign don dey certain and clear for di aspect of life; Many people wey dey under di country don dey under di control of non – state  actors , shrinking economy wey result to rising of inflation and poverty and social sector wey don fall yakata.
But the most dangerous of all is the growing lack of trust between the leadership and the led as well as among the various ethnic groups and social classes making up the country.	But  di one wey dangerous pass na di lack of trust wey dey among our leaders, pipo and all di ethnic groups and di social class of pipo wey make up di kontri.
That Nigeria is currently hurtling towards a decisive defining moment in its existence as a country cannot be denied.	Di fact say currently Nigeria don dey go toward a delicate moment of hin existence as a kontri wey no fit bi denied.
To be sure, there is no country that is immune from challenges at whatever period of its existence.	To dey sure, no kontri wey dem no face challenges from di start.
But the difference between success and failure to manage these challenges lies mainly with the leadership and how it copes with the issues of governance that come up from time to time in the life of a nation.	But di different wey dey between success and failure na di leaders wey no sabi manage di challenges and di way dem dey cope wit issues of di nation.
In this regard, looking at the degenerating situation in Nigeria across all facets of our life, the abject failure of leadership at all levels to engender confidence in their ability to come to grips with the deep challenges facing the country is glaring.	As he dey go, as we dey look di soso deteriorate wahala including di mata of our life all failure of our leaders of all levels of situations make dem take better hand hold di mata  wey dey face the kontri make he better.
Hence the dangerous but understandable doubts among a growing number of Nigerians that the countrys future existence is uncertain.	Soso many Nigerians dey doubt say di future of di kontri fit no bitter again.
This feeling is gaining greater traction as we inch towards the next circle of elections in 2023 which many believe might be more problematic than the previous ones.	Di thought of di people bi say di election wey go take place for 2023 go get plenty palava pass the ones wey we don get before.
Proceeding from the principle that a problem identified is a problem almost solved, I have identified seven major issues confronting the country not necessarily by pecking order, which require urgent attention, failing which may finally tip the country into the abyss.	Dey notice say di problem wey we see na him dey get solution, I don gather seven problems wey dey cause wahala wey need quick attention to solve and failing to solve doz problem fit make di kontri fall apart.
The Fulani question is one of the raging issues in the country which requires a nuanced perspective and approach.	Di Fulani problem na him bi di number one koko wey of di matter wey dey cause kasala wey we gat take eye look into.
It is not just about the frequently reported cases of clashes between Fulani herders and farmers in the country or the seeming ambivalence and even mutual antagonism between sedentary Fulanis and their nomadic kith and kin.	Di soso fight we don dey hear about di Fulani herders and di farmers in kontri dey cause contradictory and hatred between normal pipo and di aimless families of di Fulani’s.
It is more to do with the place of the Fulani in the historical, political and social evolution of Nigeria.	We gat put mouth for di position wey Fulani hold in di histrorical, political and social evolution of  Nigeria.
In many ways, Nigeria can be described as a joint legacy of nineteenth century Fulani Jihadist Sheikh Usman dan Fodio, and Sir Frederick Lugard, the architect of amalgamation and first British colonial Governor-General of Nigeria.	We fit describe Nigeria as country of joint legacy of nineteenth century Fulani Jihadist Sheilk Usman dan Foldio and Sir Frederick Lugard wey bi di architect of amalgamation and di first British colonial Governor-General of Nigeria
Sheikh dan Fodio	Sheilk dan Fodio
it was who first established the Fulani hegemony over an area roughly the size of two-thirds of Northern Nigeria through the Fulani led Jihad of 1804.	na di first person wey establish Fulani dominance for an area wey get di size of two – third of di Northern Nigeria for di Fulani’s wey lead di Jihad of 1804
It was on the political and social structure of this dan Fodio creation that the Britons built their colonial enterprise in Nigeria, a legacy that subsists to a large extent to this day.	Na for di political and social structure of dis dan Fodio creation wey di Britons build dia colonial enterprise for Nigeria, a legacy wey subsists to a large extent to dis day.
As a group, the Fulani are the single most powerful and influential factor in Nigerian politics.	As a group, di Fulani wey bi single most powerful and influential factors for Nigeria politics.
They control one half of the traditional/spiritual realm through the Islamic religion as well as the temporal turf of Nigerian politics and governance.	Na dem dey control one half of di traditional/spiritual realm through di Islamic religion as well as di temporal turf of Nigeria politics and governance.
That the Fulani have deployed this unique advantage in the struggle for the control of the soul of Nigerian politics opens them to accusation with some reason of wanting to perpetually control political power in the country to the exclusion and detriment of other ethnic groups.	Di Fulani don arrange dis special advantage in di struggle for di control of di soul of Nigeria politics opens dem to accusation wit some reason wey dey one use to control forever for political power in di kontri to comot and damage other ethnic groups
It is pointed out, with some justification too, that because this control and dominance work to their advantage, Fulani political aristocracy always works against the attempts by other ethnic groups for the enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.	Dem don point am out, wit som justification too, say sake of say dis kontrol and dominance work to dia advantage, Fulani political aristocracy dey always work against di attempt of oda  ethnic group for di enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.
Although this accusation against the Fulani has been on for years now, at no time has it become more pronounced than in the present time under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari who happens to be a Fulani man.	Even say dis accusation against Fulani don dey for years now, no time wey e dey more pronounced pass dis present time unda di administration of President Muhammadu Buhari wey be Fulani man.
Although some will dismiss this as part of the stuff of politics in Nigeria, the claim that Fulani wield and retain a disproportionate slice of political power to the detriment and exclusion of others is not totally unfounded, nor is it untrue that the Fulani political aristocracy has sought to perpetuate this control through a subtle agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment into the strategic areas of the countrys polity and economy.	Even say som go troway dis as part of di stuff of politiks for Nigeria, di claim say Fulani dey kontrol and retain large amount of political power in a way wey e affect and komot odas, no dey totally wrong. No be lie say di Fulani political aristocracy don find way to prolong dis kontrolthroughmago-mago agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment for di strategic areas of di kontri polity and economy.
This fulanisation agenda has predictably turned the other ethnic groups including even the closest, the Hausa, against the Fulani especially as the latter are fingered as being responsible for the banditry, kidnapping and other violent crimes in the North west of the country.	Dis fulanisation agenda, as we expect, don turn oda ethnic group includin Hausa wey be di closest, against di Fulani, especially as dem don point am say na Fulani bin dey responsible for di banditry, kidnappin and oda violent crimes for North-West of di kontri.
In the current situation that Nigeria finds itself, it is no longer feasible for the Fulani to continue to exercise the skewered and disproportionate control of political power.	In di current situation wey Nigeria dey, e no dey feasible again for Fulani to kontinue dey exercise di skewered and large kontrol of political power.
This not only creates a dangerous imbalance in the polity; it also fosters a feeling and tendency by politically excluded ethnic groups to seek ways of disrupting the polity as we are having it now.	Dis no go only create a dangerous imbalance in di polity; e go also bring up a feelin, and tendency by di ethnic groups wey dem komot for politiks, to find ways wey dem go take disrupt di polity as we dey get am now.
For Nigeria to get out of the dangerous quagmire of uncertainty currently building up, we must address the issue of a skewered political and economic control of Nigeria exercised by the powerful and influential ethnic groups to the exclusion of others.	For Nigeria to kommot for di dangerous situation of doubt wey dey build up currently, we must to address di issue of a bias political and economic kontrol of Nigeria, wey di powerful and influential ethnic groups dey show, to di exclusion of odas.
Another issue that hangs around Nigerian politics and governance like an albatross has to do with our dangerous attachments to ethnic and religious leanings and seeking to interpret everything in our country along those lines.	Anoda mata wey hang around Nigerian politiks and governance like burden wey dey pesin neck, get to do wit awa dangerous attachment to ethnic and religious ways, and awa effort to interpret evritin for awa kontri along dose lines.
We are not Nigerians in the true sense of the word.	We no be Nigerians for di true sense of di word.
Our sense of ourselves as Nigerians is defined to a large extent only by the geographical area covering the country rather than by shared values and identities.	Awa sense of togedaness as Nigerians to a large extent dey defined only by di land wey join all of us togeda rada dan by di value and identity wey we share togeda.
We identify ourselves more from our ethnic and religious perspective at the expense of the Nigeria we all belong.	Na base on my-pipo, una-pipo and my-religion una-religion level we take dey relate wit eachoda, rada dan as Nigerians wey we all be.
The proclivity to play the ethnic and religious card has become so pervasively self-perpetuating that where it is not even necessary, we try to invoke it just to assure ourselves that this is the normal thing to do.	Di proclivity to play di ethnic and religious card don becom so pervasively sef-perpetuatin to di extent say wia e no even dey necessari, we go try to invoke am jus to assure awaself say dis na di normal tin to do.
If the ethnic card does not apply, we reach for the religious card and where the religious card does not, we apply the ethnic card.	If my-pipo, una-pipo card no wok, we go use my-religion, una-religion card, and for wia dat wan no work, we go use di my-pipo una-pipo own.
We have come to believe so much in these factors as a yardstick for just about everything we do that, like an addict hooked on the self-deceiving exhilaration of the substance, we just cannot muster the courage to kick the habit even as we know how injurious it is to our body politic.	We don too biliv dis factors as yardstick for almost evritin wey we do, sotey like addict wey dey deceive e sef on di happiness of takin substance, we just fit no gada di courage to kick di habit. Even say we sabi how harmful e be to awa bodi politic.

Best ways to farm soya bean	Di best way wey we fit take use farm soya bean
According to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, planting of soya bean usually starts in June, and that it grows well on all kinds of soil, except deep soils with poor water retention.	Accordin to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, soya bean planting dey always start for June, and e dey grow well on all type of soil, except deep soil wey no fit hold water.
Dr Joseph informed farmers that an important factor to consider when embarking on soya bean farming in Nigeria was rainfall.	Dr Joseph yarn farmers say one important tin to consider wen pesin wan start soya bean farming for Nigeria na rainfall.
He said Nigeria had a very favourable climatic condition that was ideal for soya bean to flourish.	E tok say Nigeria get very gud climate wey dey perfect for soya bean to flourish.
According to him, good harvest depends mostly on adequate irrigation as the crop can also be grown in areas with lesser amounts of rainfall through irrigation.	As Awoniyi tok, gud harvest depend mostly on regular irrigation, becosthroughirrigation, di crop fit grow for areas wey no get plenti rainfall.
According to IITA, soya bean should not be planted in sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to avoid drought stress, advising that it should not be grown in waterlogged soils or soils with surfaces that can crust, as this will lead to poor seedling emergence	Accordin to IITA, make dem no plant soya bean for sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to prevent drought stress, dem advise say make dem no plant am for soil wey get plenty water or soil wit surfaces wey fit break, cos dis no go make di seed komot well.
Clear all vegetation before land preparation.	Clear all di plants wey dey, befor u prepare di land.
The seedbed may be prepared manually with a hoe or an animal-drawn implement or tractor, IITA advised.	U fit prepare di seedbed manually wit a hoe or animal-drawn equipment or tractor, IITA advise.

You can plant on ridges or on a flat seedbed, the IITA added.	IITA add am join say; U fit plant on ridges or on flat seedbed.
Experts warn that soya bean variety selection should be based on maturity, yield potential, lodging, drought tolerance and resistance to pests and diseases.	Experts don warn say to choose di type of soya bean wey u go plant, u need look at di period wey e dey take mature, di yield potential, lodging, and how well e fit tolerate drought and resist pest and disease.
John Stephen, a soya bean farmer in Garam, a Niger State community neighbouring the FCT, insisted that the maturity period should be the first consideration when choosing a variety suited to your geographical zone.	John Stephen, wey be soya bean farmer for Garam, one community for Niger State, close to di FCT, insist say na di maturity period u need to consida first wen u wan choose di type of soya bean wey fit ur location.
Stephen advised that, Consider varieties that are earlier maturing rather than late maturing in areas with low rainfall.	Stephen advise say, for areas wey get low rainfall, make u consida di seed wey dey mature early rada dan di one wey dey mature late.
Although later maturity increases the yield potential, it is risky to grow late maturing varieties in drier environments because of late season drought.	Although seed wey dey mature late dey always get beta yield, but e dey risky to plant late maturing seed for dry environments becos of late season drought.
IITA advised farmers to use high quality seeds of the selected variety as soya bean seeds easily lose their viability.	IITA advise farmers say make di type of seed wey dem go choose be of high quality becos soya bean seeds dey quick lose dia viability.
According to the institute, it is common for soya bean, even when stored properly, not to germinate after 12 to 15 months in storage.	According to di institute, e dey common for soya bean not to grow afta 12 to 15 monts wey e don dey for storage, even wen dem keep am well.
Therefore, use seeds that are not more than 12 months old to ensure good germination.	So, make u use seed wey never pass 12 monts so e go fit germinate well.
Sort out the good seeds for planting to ensure that they are free from insects, disease infestation and weed seeds.	Select di gud seed komot for planting so u go fit make sure say dem no get insect, disease, or weed seeds.
Do not purchase seeds from the open market as the germination potential is not guaranteed.	Make u no buy seed from open market, cos di ability for di seed to germinate no guarantee.
Planting poor quality seeds will not produce a good yield,	Planting seed wey get poor quality no go produce beta yield.

Start counting the seedlings five days after sowing and complete the counting within 10 days.	Begin dey count di seedlings five days afta planting and complete di counting within 10 days.
A total count of 320 germinated seeds or more indicates a germination rate of 80 percent and above.	If u fit count a total of 320 seeds wey germinate, e mean say di germination rate of di seed na 80 percent and above.
When the percentage of germination is 80 percent or less, the seed rate has to be increased accordingly to achieve 100 percent.	Wen di percentage of germination na 80 percent or less, u go need increase di seed rate to achieve 100 percent.
Fertiliser application	Fertiliser application
IITA advises that a good fertiliser recommendation for soya bean production depends on a good soil test.	IITA advise say to recommend beta fertiliser for soya bean production, pesin go need to do a gud soil test.
Under normal conditions, soya bean as a legume should provide itself with nitrogen through biological nitrogen fixation.	For normal kondition, soya bean as legume wey e be suppose provide esef wit nitrogenthroughbiological nitrogen fixation.
Until nodulation occurs, the soya bean plant depends on soil nitrogen for growth.	Until nodulation don happun, di soya bean plant go dey depend on di soil nitrogen to grow.
Phosphorus is often the most deficient nutrient, therefore, apply optimum phosphorous fertiliser for good yield.	Phosphorus na im di plant dey lack pass, derefor, make u put di best phosphorous fertiliser so e go fit grow well.

Pastor Adefarasin, if Nigeria is a scam; then were all scammers	Pastor Adefarasin; if Nigeria na scam; den all of us na scammers
It is the bounden duty of every citizen to hold the government to account.	Na di compulsory duty of everi citizen to hold di government to account.
In fact, citizenship is a call to duty  for the state.	In fact, citizenship na call to duty for di state.
And there is no compelling duty which supersedes citizens subjecting their employees  the government  to scrutiny and constant vigilance.	And no compulsory duty wey pass make citizens dey scrutinize and monitor dia employees “ di government“ frequently.
Criticising the government is within the rights of every citizen, and active citizenship demands taking the government through its paces.	Criticising di government na part of di rights of everi citizen, and active citizenship get to do wit takin di governmentthroughe pace.
No government is without criticism, and none is too special for criticism.	No government wey dem no dey criticise, and no government too special for pipo to criticise.
However, we must distinguish between any government and Nigeria as a country.	But, we need differentiate between any government and Nigeria as a kontri.
Governments will come and go, but Nigeria remains.	Government go kom and go, but Nigeria go remain.
We must understand Nigeria is its people.	We need understand say Nigeria na di pipo wey dey inside.
So, when we cast pejoratives at the country we are only slinging shots at ourselves.	So, wen we belittle di kontri, we just dey shoot awasef for leg.
If we say, Nigeria is a scam, inadvertently we are implying, Nigerians are scammers.	If we tok say Nigeria na scam, indirectly wetin we mean be say, Nigerians be scammers.
Nigeria did not become a scam, as some of those reviling the nation say, by accident; it became whatever it is by the machination of all of us.	Nigeria no be scam, like som of dose wey dey abuse di nation dey always tok, unknowingly; Na we turn Nigeria to anytin wey e be.
Nigeria is not a mere geographical expression.	Nigeria no be just a place somwia.
Nigeria is its people.	Nigeria na di pipo.
The good, the bad and the ugly  we made it so.	Di gud, di bad and di ugly “ na we make am be laidat.
Whatever is ailing the country we are a vector of the causative factors.	Anytin wey dey affect di kontri, na we be di agent wey cause am.
If Nigeria is a scam  as alleged by Pastor Paul Adefarasin  then we are all scammers.	If Nigeria na scam as Pastor Paul Adefarasin tok, den we all be scammers.
Though I concede that Adefarasins outburst might have come from a place of patriotism, his cataloguing of Nigeria as a scam and fraud falls short of tact and critical reasoning.	Even say I agree, say Adefarasin anger na becos of di love wey e get for di kontri, im comment say Nigeria na scam and fraud no dey reasonable.
If Nigeria is a fraud; then we are all fraudsters  leaders and followers alike.	If Nigeria na fraud; den all of us be fraudster, leaders and followers join.
We all have contributed in no small measure to the discomfiture of the entity.	All of us don contribute to di dissapointment of di entity.
We live in a country where pastors run their ministries like conglomerates.	We dey live for a kontri wia pastors dey run dia ministry like business.
They run them like business enterprises  but evading tax in the process.	Dem dey run am like business enterprise but dem no dey pay tax for dere.
CAMA; a law to regulate the business undertakings of the religious industry and to bring some transparency and accountability into the spiritual business was introduced by the government.	CAMA; Government introduce a law wey go regulate di business undertaking of di religious industry and wey go bring som transparency and accountability inside di spiritual business.
However, the staunchest antagonists of this law have been pastors.	But na pastors dey against dis law pass.
Yet, these same people who do not want to live by the law are the loudest voices when passing capital sentences on Nigeria.	Still, na dis same pipo wey no wan follow di law be di loudest voice wen dem dey pass capital sentence on Nigeria.
Interestingly, these pastors run their churches in conformity with the law in other countries.	Funny tin be say, dis pastors dey follow di law of oda kontri dey run dia church for dose kontri.
They submit their finances for regular checks by the authorities in the UK, the US and other places.	Dem dey submit dia finance for regular check by di authorities for UK, US and oda places.
But in Nigeria they live in triumph of the law.	But for Nigeria dem dey live above di law.
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome has been spreading injurious falsehood regarding COVID vaccine.	Pastor Chris Oyakhilome don dey spread harmful lies about COVID vaccine.
He claims it is the concoction of the anti-Christ.	E claim say na di concoction of di anti-Christ.
He was fined 125,000 pounds for making potentially harmful and unsubstantiated claims about the vaccine by the UK.	Dem fine am 125,000 pounds for Uk, sake of say e dey tok harmful and unsubstantiated tins about di vaccine.
But in Nigeria where he continues to traffic in COVID conspiracies, he has not been made to account for his transgressions because he is a man of god.	But for Nigeria wia e dey kontinue to bring different COVID conspiracy, dem neva call am to kom explain im offence, sake of say na man of god e be.
Perhaps, this is why Nigeria is a scam.	Maybe na why Nigeria be scam.
If Nigeria is a scam, then it is because of pastors who sit on high and trample on the laws governing the land.	If Nigeria na scam, den na becos of pastors wey dey siddun for top, kom dey step on di law wey dey govern di land.
If Nigeria is a fraud, then it is because of pastors who go into concordats with politicians every election season; campaigning for them on the pulpit and commanding the bloodhounds of hell against those who do not accept their anointed candidates.	If Nigeria na fraud, den na becos of pastors wey dey sign agreement wit politicians everi election period; dey campaign for dem on di altar, dey command di demons of hell untop dose wey no gree accept dia anointed candidate.
The clergy is as tainted as the political class.	Clergymen dey as corrupt as di politikal class.
Also, a civil servant, who earns N150,000 monthly but has kids in UK schools and with real estate dotting major cities in the country, will revile Nigeria submerging his own hypocrisy in lamentations and jibes at the state.	Also, civil servant, wey dey collect N150,000 per month, but get pikin for UK school, and property for all ova di major cities of di kontri, go abuse Nigeria and carry all im hypocrisy put for lamentation and insult to di state.
He ignores conveniently his complicity in the corruption ravaging the country.	E go calm down ignore e own contribution for di corruption wey dey destroy di kontri.
In addition, some citizens spurn laws, rules and regulations.	Also, som citizens dey reject laws, rules and regulations.
Where there are traffic lights, they ignore them; where there are procedures, they bypass them, and where there are standards put in place for effective service delivery and operations, they abandon them.	Wia traffic light dey, dem go ignore am; wia protocol dey, dem go bypass am, and for places wia dem don get standard for gud service delivery and operations, dem go abandon am.
Yet, they all blame â€˜Nigeria for the jeopardous status quo as if the country exists without its people.	Still, all of dem go blame Nigeria for di bad status quo as if say di kontri dey exist witout di pipo.
The problem with Nigeria is a people problem.	Di problem wey Nigeria get na pipo problem.
But the tragedy is that no one wants to accept liability for the appalling state of things.	But di bad tin be say nobodi wan take responsibility for di terrible way wey tins be.
We cast the blame at the feet of abstract Nigeria.	We dey blame di Nigeria wey no exist.
We are all complicit in the degenerative emasculation of Nigeria.	Na all of us get hand for inside di bad situation of Nigeria.
Instead of abiding in wilful fatalism about Nigeria, we should project goodness and positivity into the system while working at making our country what we want it to be.	Instead make we dey follow di tin wey we don conclude about Nigeria, make we forsee goodness and positivity into di system, and make we dey work to make awa kontri di tin wey we want make e be.
Nigeria is what we make of it.	Nigeria go be wetin we want make e be.
The political class is flawed.	Di politicians get comma.
But that is the reason a new generation of leaders must emerge and take the reins.	But dat na di reason why new generation of leaders must come up and take kontrol.
None but ourselves can free our minds.	Nobodi fit free awa mind except us.
Citizenship is a call to duty.	Citizenship na call to duty.
NIGERIA IS NOT A SCAM.	NIGERIA NO BE SCAM.
Why secession is not the Silver Bullet to Nigerias challenges	Why separation no be di Silver Bullet to Nigeria challenges
The principle of self-determination as enshrined in the UN charter and which our secessionists latch on to was enacted at a time many peoples of the world were under colonial yoke or other forms of domination by outside powers.	Di principle of self-determination as e dey for di UN charter wey awa pipo wey wan separate hold-on to, take effect for a time wey many pipo for di world dey under colonial yoke or oda form of kontrol by outside power.
The principle was to give fillip to independence and liberation movements in order for them to gain their freedom and determine their path of future development.	Di principle na to give chance to independence and liberation movements so dem go fit gain dia freedom and determine dia path of future development.
In our world today, this principle applies only to a handful of peoples as an overwhelming majority of the world are now free from colonial subjugation and self-governing.	For di world wey we dey today, dis principle only apply to few pipo, becos majority of di world don dey free from colonial kontrol and sef-governing.
Thus the principle of self-determination, which was enacted under the UN charter, will have to be amended to accommodate the demands of our secessionists because going by its intendment and wordings they hardly qualify.	So dem go need adjust di principle of sef-determination, wey dem establish under di UN charter, so e go fit accommodate di demand of awa pipo wey wan separate, becos if we follow wetin dey dere, dem no qualify.
First of all, they have to prove constructively and convincingly that the areas they purport to represent are under some form of subjugation and that they lack the basic freedoms that all peoples should enjoy as required under the UN charter.	First of all, dem go need to prove carefully and convincingly say di area wey dem claim to represent dey under som form of kontrol, and say dem dey lack di basic freedom wey everibodi suppose enjoy as e dey di UN charter.
And in the unlikely case of proving that, they will also have to convince the UN of the steps they have taken from the national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to press their case.	And for wia dem wan prove dat one, dem go need convince di UN on di steps wey dem don take, from di national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to present dia case.
And the UN will not just take their word for it.	And di UN no go just take dia word laidat.
There will be fact finding committees to determine whether indeed Nigeria as a country practises the basic requirements of democracy or not.	Dem go get committee wey go confam di fact to know weda true-true, Nigeria as a kontri dey practise di basic requirement of demokracy or not.
The case is even made trickier by the fact that those areas are neither disputed territories nor under any trusteeship requiring a UN referendum to either confer direct independence to them or ask them which of the competing powers they wished to join.	Dem don even complicate di case wit di fact say dose areas no be area wey dem dey fight untop, and no be area wey dey under any trusteeship wey go need UN referendum to give dem direct independence or ask dem who dem wan join inside di pipo wey dey fight untop di place.
If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.	If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.
It does not lend its very elaborate and transparent processes to be abused by movements that hardly know what they are about.	E no dey give chance make som movement wey no know wetin dem dey about abuse im wide and transparent process.
The case of marginalisation, which is also cited as one of the reasons for secession, is too trivial to even waste our time on.	Di case of marginalisation, wey dem mention as part of di reason for separation, dey too simple to waste awa time untop.
Every democratic system provides for winners and losers in elections.	Na everi democratik system dey get winner and loser for election.
And as imperfect as our political system is, the constitution compels mandatory representation in government and its institutions for as many ethnic nationalities and geo-political zones as possible.	And as awa politikal system no perfect reach, di konstitution make am compulsory say as many ethnic group and geo-political zones as possible must get representative for government and im institutions.
The secessionist would have a tough time convincing the outside world that their case for marginalisation is more compelling than those of the over 300 other ethnic nationalities inhabiting Nigeria.	E go tough for di pipo wey wan separate to convince di outside world say dia case of marginalisation dey more compelling pass dat of more dan 300 oda ethnic group wey dey Nigeria.
In other words, why would the international community, to which the secessionists address their grievances and from which they seek support for their cause, single out just two out of the hundreds of such cases ringing in the Nigerian media for action?	Wetin dis one mean be say, why di international community, wey di pipo wey wan separate dey report and seek support from go single out jus two out of like hundred of dat kind case wey dey ring for di Nigerian media say na im dem go work on ?
What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?	What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?
On all the three premises that our secessionists base their agitations, none is convincing or compelling enough to justify their actions.	Out of all di three tins wey make awa secessionists dey agitate, no one dey convincing or compelling enough to justify dia action.
On the amalgamation argument, Nigeria is not a unique case in Africa or indeed the world.	On di amalgamation argument, Nigeria own no be special case for Afrika or for di world.
If Nigeria has to be broken up because it was wrongly amalgamated by Britain, then this applies to virtually all but a few countries in Africa.	If Nigeria go need break up unto say Britain no join am well, den dis go be di case of almost all di kontris for Afrika.
In essence if this principle were to be applied it will set the course for the commencement of a new scramble for Africa by the old and emerging powers of the world in which Africans as before will be the victims.	In short, if dem use dis principle, e go start di course to begin a new scramble for Africa by di old and upcoming world powers, and like befor, na Afrikans go be di victim.
Let us not deceive ourselves for the disintegration of Nigeria if it happens (God forbid) will result in the emergence of entities	Make we no deceive awasef, becos if di break-up of Nigeria happun (God forbid), e go lead to di birth of kontris
too weak such that they will find themselves at the mercy of foreign powers.	wey go dey weak sotey, dem go dey beg from di foreign powers.
Some arguments have been made of a break up of Nigeria along the lines of Eastern European states and in the Balkans.	We don get som argument wey dey compare di break up of Nigeria wit dat of Eastern European states and di Balkans.
In this regard, it will serve us well to discern that what works for Europe may not necessarily work for Africa.	Untop dis one, e go beta make we undastand well say di tin wey work for Europe fit no work for Africa.
In the case of the aforementioned countries, it was part of great geo-strategic games of the major world powers who had direct cultural, economic and political links and interests in the emerging scenarios.	In di case of di kontris wey we mention, na part of di great geo-strategic games of di major world powers wey get direct cultural, economik and politikal link and interest for di emerging scenario.
And these countries had defined borders before they agreed to come together for mutual defence in the uncertain situation of the Second World War.	And dis kontris don get clear boundary befor dem agree to kom togeda for mutual defence durin di uncertain situation of di Second World War.
Once the Soviet order, which held them together, began to unravel the need arose for the peripheral countries to revert to the status quo ante.	Immediately di Soviet order, wey join dem togeda begin dey scatter, all dis kontris need go back to di status quo ante.
And, more importantly, these developments had the backing and guarantees of the principal powers in Europe and the world in the quest for a balance of power.	And, more importantly, dis developments get di backing and guarantee of di important powers for Europe and di world.
Do Nigerian secessionists have such reckoning and profile in the calculations of the principal powers of the world to warrant their time?	Se Nigerian secessionists get dat kind recognition and profile in di face of di principal powers of di world wey go make dem answer dem?
The answer obviously is zilch.	Surely, di answer na zero.
This is, however, not dismissing that the agitations for secession in the country do not have some justifiable basis.	Dis no kom mean say di agitation of pipo to separate for di kontri no get som gud reason.
Anybody living in this country with the rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainties amidst the unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of the government to these challenges will conclude that indeed we have a state that is failing in its basic constitutional duties and responsibilities.	Anybodi wey dey live for dis kontri wit dis rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainty and di unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of di government to dis challenges go conclude say truly, we dey for a kontri wey dey fail for im basic konstitutional duties and responsibilities.
And in a fragile country like ours with gaping fault lines, tendencies or preferences for dissolution of the union are bound to emerge and grow exponentially along with the clear dysfunctionality of the government of the day.	And for a fragile kontri like awa own, wey get plenti fault, e dey normal for tendency or preference for separation to arise and grow fast wit di clear dysfunctionality of di government wey dey.
And these feelings are all round.	And na everybodi get dis dis feeling.
But daunting as the outlook is and tempting as the prospect appears, secession cannot be the solution to our existential challenges as a nation.	But as discouragin as di outlook be, and as temptin as di outcome dey appear, separation no fit be di solution to awa current challenge as a nation.
Indeed it is a prospect fraught with lurking uncertain dangers not least for its proponents but for the country as a whole.	Indeed na prospect wey get som unknown dangers, danger wey no be for di secessionists alone but for di kontri as a whole.
Nigeria is not imperfect.	Nigeria no dey perfect.
Even some of the advanced countries have shown that despite years of existence and well defined systems, they are not immune from crises arising from internal contradictions.	Even som of di advance kontris don show say despite dia years of existence and dia gud systems, dem no dey free from crises wey dey kom from internal conflict.
We should not delude ourselves that in trying to break up our country, some countries will benevolently assist us.	Make we no dey deceive awasef say as we dey try break up awa kontri, som kontris go graciously assist us.
What they will do is provide us with the means to destroy and weaken ourselves in the process and then proceed to profit from that at our own expense.	Wetin dem go do na to give us di means to destroy and weaken awasef, so dem go fit benefit while we go suffer am.
That is the reality of the international system.	Na di truth about di international system be dat.
As the distinguished German beamter at the beginning of my article said and advised; we are at once our own problems and our own solutions.	As di popular German beamter tok for di beginnin of my paper; Na we be awa own problem and solution join togeda.
We must put our thoughts, talents and efforts collectively to developing Nigeria rather than breaking it up.	We need put awa mind, talent and effort togeda to develop Nigeria instead say we wan breaking am.

What Kano needs in 2023	Wetin Kano need for 2023
Kano needs to chart a new path to development in 2023.	Kano need create new path to development for 2023.
This is because the state is sliding into the pit of poverty.	Dis na becos di state don dey enta di pit of poverty.
Our rich pre-colonial history indicates that Kano was the richest of all Hausa states because of state involvement in the economy.	Awa rich pre-colonial history show say na Kano rich pass for all di Hausa states, becos di state dey involve for di economy.
Although, the colonialists destroyed the economic foundation of Kano and other colonised societies the policies of those who led the Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contributed to maintaining Kano as the leading economic centre of Northern Nigeria.	Even say di colonialists destroy di economic foundation of Kano and oda society wey dem colonise, di policy of di pipo wey lead di Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contribute to make Kano remain as di leadin economic centre of Northern Nigeria.
For example, they established the first modern water treatment plant in the region in 1931, the first independent power plant in Northern Nigeria of 15mw and for over 80 years, no similar one has been established in Northern Nigeria.	For example, dem establish di first modern water treatment plant wey dey di region for 1931, di first independent power plant for Northern Nigeria, wey get 15MW, and for more dan 80 years, dem neva establish any one wey resemble am for Northern Nigeria.
They established the first industrial estate in the Northern Region, they inherited one primary school in 1926 and by 1963 every village had a primary school (hundreds), they established secondary schools, they inherited no hospital (but one dispensary) and by 1963 there were two general hospitals and hundreds of dispensaries in every village headed by Dagachi had one.	Dem establish di first industrial estate wey dey di Northern Region, dem inherit only one primary school for 1926, and for 1963 everi village don get primary school (more dan hundred), dem establish secondary schools, dem no meet any hospital (except one dispensary) and for 1963 dem don build two general hospital and more dan hundred dispensaries for everi village.
They laid the foundation of modern Kano.	Na dem lay di foundation of modern Kano.
Politically, they made the NPC to become the ruling party of Nigeria.	Politikally, na dem make di NPC becom di rulin party for Nigeria.
From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintained its position as second to Lagos.	From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintain im position as di second to Lagos.
Kano does not have control over macro-economic policies but its leaders can provide the enabling environment for economic growth.	Kano no get kontrol ova macro-economic policy but e leaders fit provide di right environment for economic growth.
For example, the Dawanau Market, which is the largest grains market in West Africa bringing people from all parts of the continent from as far as Gabon and Congo.	For example, di Dawanau Market, wey still be di biggest grain market for West Africa, e dey bring pipo from all part of di kontinent, even from far place like Gabon and Congo.
This was all as a result of the foresight of Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless his soul), who established the market.	All dis na result of di foresight wey Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless im soul), wey establish di market get.
The three administrations that governed Kano from 1999 to date, could all claim that each one of them was the best thing that has happened to Kano but why has Kano degenerated to number nine in Nigeria?	Di three administration wey don rule Kano from 1999 till today, fit claim say all of dem be di best tin wey don happun to Kano, but why Kano don reduce to numba nine for Nigeria?
There is no single project that has brought any significant economic change in Kano despite several efforts by concerned individuals.	One single project no dey wey don bring correct economic change for Kano, even afta plenti effort of consign pipo.
If there is elite focus and determination, with state leadership as it was in the pre-colonial period, Kano would not have gone down to number nine in Nigeria with a GDP of $13.30b after Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).	If di elite dey focus and determine, wit state leadership as e dey for di pre-colonial period, Kano no go go down to numba nine for Nigeria wit GDP of $13.30b afta Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).
The catastrophe in the next 10 years if not averted now, will be beyond our imagination.	If we no prevent am now, we no go fit imagine di disaster wey go kom in di next 10 years.
This is because of many reasons, one of which is we have over four million pupils in public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 they would have completed secondary education.	Dis na becos of many reasons. One of dem be say we get more dan four million pupils for public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 dem go don finish secondary education.
Assuming only 10 percent of them (400,000) will proceed to higher-level can the government fund their education?	Assume say na onli 10 percent of dem (400,000) go go higher-level, di government go fit sponsor dia education?
After completing higher education, can the economy absorb them with gainful employment?	Afta dem complete higher education, di economy go fit give dem beta employment?
At the current state of development, it cannot.	As e be so, e no fit.
This is because, there are over 250 medical doctors and over 1000 nurses sponsored by the state government, who could not be absorbed despite the need.	Dis na becos, more dan 250 medical doctors and more dan 1000 nurses wey di state government dey sponsor, na im dem no fit employ.
We keep deceiving ourselves with so-called skills acquisition programmes that train artisans who will not get any job after acquiring the skills because the local economy cannot absorb them.	We go dey deceive awasef wit di skills acquisition programme wey dey train artisans wey no go get any job afta dem learn di skills, sake of say di local economy no fit employ dem.
Every day we hear billions allocated by the federal government for one economic programme or the other and yet our ideas are never beyond training plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.	Everi day we dey hear billions wey federal government allocate for one economic programme or di oda, and still, we no dey reason pass to train plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.
Our ideas, so far, are not about harnessing resources for the employment of a larger population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) did when he started the city walls.	Since, awa idea no dey about how we go use resources employ di large population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) do wen e begin di city walls.
We have to think out of the box.	We need tink outside di box.
Kano does not need a superhuman being with the best qualifications and experience or a saint as the next governor.	Kano no need genius wey get di best qualification and experience, or saint as di next governor.
This is because the governors in the last 20 years possessed some of the best qualities and might have even done their best but as we can all see, the outcome has not been the best for the state.	Dis na becos di governors wey dey for di last 20 years get som of di best quality, and dem fit even don do dia best, but as all of us dey see, di result no be di best for di state.
Therefore, we must think out of the box.	So, we need reason outside di box.
The two parties APC and PDP cannot provide the desired leadership because they are controlled by godfathers, not ideologically driven, but mainly concerned with sharing of state resources.	Di two parties, APC and PDP no fit provide di kind leadership wey we want, sake of say na godfathers dey kontrol dem, and dem no get idea on wetin to do, but dia main focus na how to share di state resources.
The best they can offer is to negotiate for a governor who will serve the interest of a godfather or a clique.	Di best tin wey dem fit do na to negotiate for governor wey go serve di interest of a godfather or cabal.
Therefore, the two parties are not the best options.	So, di two parties no be di best option.
A very good person could emerge using his resources or with the help of other well-meaning patriotic people.	Beta pesin fit kom outside on e own, or wit di help of oda beta patriotic pipo.
He could win through any efforts including negotiating with even any of the two parties or another party.	E fit use any way win, even if e negotiate wit any of di two parties or anoda party sef.
This is a possibility.	E dey possible
It has happened before.	E  don happun befor.
An example, in the neighbouring Kaduna State, is Nasir Elrufai.	One example wey dey near us na Nasir Elrufai for Kaduna State.
He is one of the best in his generation but security in the state is beyond him because he depends on his personal intelligence and capacity.	Im be one of di best for im generation, but di security situation for di state don pass im power, sake of say e dey depend on im personal intelligence and capacity.
A better person than him in Kano will not make it the desired place unless certain fundamentals are changed.	Pesin wey beta pass am for Kano no go make di place beta unless dem change som important tins.
I do not claim to have all the answers or even to be exclusively original in the ideas below.	I no claim say I get all di answer or even say na me get all di idea wey dey down.
Some of them are even modifications of Aminu Kanos ideas.	Som of dem na part of Aminu Kano idea.
There are many better ideas in the minds of more intelligent people.	Plenti beta idea dey for di mind of more intelligent pipo.
The ideas I am suggesting are based on my little experience as a labourer of politicians and some training outside this country.	Di idea wey I dey suggest na base on my small experience as labourer of politicians and som trainin wey I get outside dis kontri.
Kano is on the crossroad, therefore, these ideas could be useful.	Right now, Kano dey crossroad, and dis ideas fit dey useful.
Some people need to come together and organise a political movement not owned by any individual but people willing to sacrifice.	Som pipo need kom togeda to organise one political movement wey no dey in kontrol of anybodi but pipo wey wan sacrifice.
It should kindly consider the suggestions below:	Make dem look di suggestion below:
There is a need to initiate political organisation at the lowest level and making the members own it.	Need dey for us to start political organisation at di lowest level and make sure say na di members dey in kontrol.
No material reward but sacrifice.	Material reward no go dey, but sacrifice.
This is possible with mobilisation and the right messages.	Dis dey possible wit mobilisation and di right message.
Before the election, the movement or party must take a comprehensive inventory of the state and design a comprehensive action plan with specific measurable targets.	Befor di election, di movement or party need take detail inventory of di state and design comprehensive action plan wit specific targets wey dey measurable .
There should be operational guidelines for all appointees including the governor, which must be popularised for every citizen to know and challenge if breeched.	Operational guidelines go dey for all appointees plus di governor, and dem go need announce am so every citizen go fit know and challenge, if dem no follow am.
No one who seeks any position should be given such a position in the movement or party from the lowest level to the highest.	Anybodi wey dey find position inside di movement or party, go begin from di lowest level to di highest.
Some will argue this kills ambition.	Som pipo go argue say dis strategy go kill ambition.
What is needed now is not ambition but a sustainable system owned by the people.	Wetin we need now no be ambition but sustainable system wey dey in kontrol of di pipo.
Similarly, no one should be given any position until he fulfils certain basic conditions of competence and honesty as well as bringing references and guarantors.	Also, make dem no give anybodi any position unless e don fulfil som basic condition of competence and honesty, and e go bring reference and guarantor.
All public officials must publicly declare their assets and those of their family members on the assumption of office, which must be verified by forensic experts.	All public officers must declare dia asset publicly, and dia family members own join, immediately dem reach office. And forensic experts go need verify everytin .
Their salaries, expenses (including travels, entertainment etc) must be made public periodically.	From time to time, di public need dey know dia salary and expenses (plus travel, entertainment etc).
No one who becomes a governor or attains any position should ever be allowed to act unilaterally.	Anybodi wey becom governor or reach any position no go ever do tins on e own.
The governor must never be allowed	Di governor no go ever
To make appointments unilaterally.	Make appointment alone.
There must be criteria, expectations or set targets for such appointments for periodic assessments and evaluations; 	Criteria, go dey, dem go need set expectation or target for dose kind appointment, and dem go need dey assess and evaluate am from time to time.
All contracts must be transparently awarded after evaluation by experts from within and outside the bureaucracy.	All contract wey dem go award go dey fair and transparent, and expert inside and outside di government bureaucracy must evaluate am.
Allocations of plots must also be transparent.	Allocation of plots must dey transparent too.
No governor should be allowed to have absolute control of the treasury and it should be administered by competent staff.	No governor go get total kontrol of di treasury and na competent staff go dey in charge .
The governor should only be seen as the leader who guides institutions to develop and end one-man rule.	Di governor go be di leader wey go guide all di institution to develop and end one-man rule.
If the governor is liberated from this prison of power, he will lead the state to greatness.	If di governor dey free from dis prison of power, e go lead di state to greatness.
He will lead by example and corruption will be minimised because the avenues of abuse of power have been blocked.	E go lead by example and corruption go reduce becos dem don block all di way wey e fit use abuse power.
A governor should be seen to supervise public servants and ensure everyone performs his duties diligently.	Governor suppose dey to supervise public servants and make sure say everybodi do im duty well.
He should inspire his people with exemplary lifestyles, commitment to service and transparency.	E suppose inspire im pipo wit good lifestyle, commitment to service and transparency.
