My personal experience is that since the advance of coronavirus and COVID-19, it has been that, much as coronavirus is an individual specific condition, it, however, also arouses the collective response whereby you find that an individual presents with symptoms such as your anxiety, your panic attack, and your depression.	Maitemogelo a me ke gore, fa e sale coronavirus le COVID-19 di ntse di gola, e nnile gore, jaaka  fa coronavirus e le bolwetse jwa motho yo o rileng, e batla tsibogo e e kopanetsweng, mo o fitlhelang e le gore motho o na le matshwao a a tshwanang le kgatelelo ya tlhaloganyo, letshogo le kgatelelo ya maikutlo.
However, you will realise that the situation affects not only an individual but the whole systems surrounding an individual as the family, as other important sectors of the society, like your work, like your institutions such as school.	Le fa go le jalo, o tla lemoga gore maemo a, ga a ame motho a le mongwe fela mme a ama le dilo tse di go dikaganyeditseng jaaka ba lelapa, le ditheo tse dingwe tsa botlhokwa tsa setšhaba, jaaka tiro ya gago, jaaka ditheo tsa gago jaaka sekolo.

Marcelo Toledo usually creates sculptures and jewellery out of metal.	Marcelo Toledo go le gale o dira ditshwantsho tse di takilweng le dibenya ka go dirisa tshipi.
Now the Argentine artist is working with a new material: waste masks and syringes from the COVID-19 pandemic to create an exhibition exploring the painful impact of the virus.	Jaanong motaki yo wa kwa Argentina, o dira ka dilo tse dintšhwa: Matlakala a dimaseke le mamao a a neng a dirisetswa leroborobo la COVID-19 go dira pontsho ya go sekaseka seabe se se botlhoko se mogare o nnileng le sona.
Toledo, who has made jewellery for the musical Evita on Broadway and unique pieces for Barack Obama and Madonna, was among the first in Argentina to contract COVID-19 a year ago, which left him hospitalised for eight days with pneumonia.	Toledo, yo o dirileng dibenya tsa mmino wa Evita kwa Broadway le tse dingwe tse di kgethegileng tse a di diretseng Barack Obama le Madonna, e ne e le mongwe wa batho ba ntlha kwa Argentina go tsenwa ke mogare wa COVID-19 mo ngwageng o o fetileng, e e robaditseng kwa bookelong ka ntlha ya pneumonia.
The experience left an imprint on his life and triggered a flurry of artworks, from a 14-meter mask with the Argentine flag that he placed on the iconic Obelisk in Buenos Aires to raise awareness about organ donation during the pandemic.	Maitemogelo a, a tlogetse letshwao mo botshelong jwa gagwe mme a mo fa le maatla a go  dira ditshwantsho tsa botaki, go tloga ka maseke wa dimetara di le  14 o o nang le folaga ya kwa Argentina o a neng a beile kwa Obelisk kwa Buenos Aires go dira temoso ka ga go abelana ka dithwe ka mmele ka nako ya leroborobo
For his new exhibition, the Museum of the After, Toledo is collecting recycled coronavirus waste sent by hospitals, laboratories and random people.	Kwa pontshong ya gagwe, “The Museum of the After”, Toledo o kokoanya matlakala a didiriswa tsa Corona Virus a a rometsweng ke maokelo, dilaboratoriamo le batho fela.
It includes old vaccines and medical parts, and newspaper clippings about the pandemic.	A akaretsa meento ya kgale le dikarolo tsa kalafi, le dikgang tsa mo kuranteng ka ga leroborobo.
I am excited to be able to transform pain into beauty and this exhibition is just that, capturing everything that is happening to us as a society, Toledo, 45, told Reuters in his workshop in the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires.	Ke itumeletse go kgona go fetola botlhoko go nna bontle mme pontsho e, ke sona tota seo, e bontsha sengwe le sengwe se se diragalang mo go rona jaaka setšhaba, Toledo, 45, o boleletse  Reuters kwa tirong ya gagwe ya go tlhabana botlhale kwa San Telmo, kwa kgaolong ya Buenos Aires.
The artworks, which will go on show from September in a public space in downtown Buenos Aires, will all be made from disposable materials or garbage that people send me, many of them sealed inside vacuum-packed bags.	Ditshwantsho tsa botaki, tse di tlaa tlhagisiwang go tloga ka Lwetse kwa lefelong la botlhe kwa toropong ya Buenos Aires, tsotlhe di tlaa be di dirilwe ka didiriswa tse di latlhilweng kgotsa matlakala a ke a romelelwang ke batho, bontsi jwa ona bo tsentswe mo ka fa gare ga dikgetsi tse di tswetsweng.
It is the first time that I do an exhibition in which I do not have to buy any of the elements, he said.	Ke la ntlha ke dira pontsho e mo go  yona ke ne ke sa tlhoke go reka dikarolo dipe. A bua jalo.
It will all be enclosed or put in capsules because we should never forget this.	E tlaa be e tswaletswe kgotsa e tsentswe ka mo gare ga sejana gonne ga re a tshwanela go e lebala.
So the idea is that everything can be preserved over time.	Ka jalo, kakanyo ke gore, dilo tsotlhe di ka bolokiwa mo tsamaong ya nako.
In the exhibition, there will be a real ship that symbolically crosses a storm and recycling islands to raise awareness about the importance of caring for the environment.	Mo pontshong e, go tlaa nna le sekepe sa nnete se se tlaa  kgabaganyang dinokana le go  dirasešwa ga ditlhaketlhake go dira temoso ka ga botlhokwa jwa go tlhokomela tikologo.
The exhibition will tell the story of this ship that went sailing and was stranded after the storm, which is a great metaphor for what is happening to us.	Pontsho e, e tlaa tlotla kgang ka ga sekepe se se neng se tsamaya mo metsing, mme sa sala se iphotlhere morago ga matlakadibe. Se ke tshwantshiso e ntle ya se se re diragalelang.
This pandemic, its a great global storm, Toledo said.	Leroborobo leno, ke matlakadibe a magolo mo lefatsheng, Toledo o buile jalo.
As with the giant mask, which was replicated in countries such as the United States and Japan, the artist dreams of reproducing the new exhibition in other cities around the world.	Jaaka ka maseke o mogolo o, o o neng wa dirwa gape kwa dinageng  tse di jaaka United States le Japan, motaki yo, o na le ditoro tsa go ntsifatsa pontsho e ntšhwa mo ditoropong tse dingwe mo lefatsheng lotlhe.
The idea of this Museum of the After is, on one hand, to look for elements from all over the world, and also to be able to replicate it in other places and even get a physical museum to leave the work for posterity, he said.	Kgopolo ya gagwe ya “The Museum of the After”, ka fa letlhakoreng le lengwe, ke go tlhokomela dikarolo go tswa mo lefatsheng ka bophara, mme gape le go kgona go e dira gape mo mafelong a mangwe, le go bona musiamo wa nnete o kwa go ona go ka tlogelwang tiro e gore e somarelelwe dikokomane tsa isago, a rialo.

Go tloga jaanong, Kgotlatshekelo ke yona e tlaa tsayang tshwetso ya dikaro tseo mo baneng ba ba nang le dipharologano tsa bong, Lereo la bongaka le gantsi le dirisiwang fa buiwa ka batho ba ba nang le dithwe tsa bonna le tsa bosadi..
About 1.7% of babies are born intersex, according to the United Nations, with a small proportion undergoing operations to bring the appearance and function of their genitalia into line with that expected of males or females.

Research suggests that unnecessary surgeries performed without childrens consent can lead to psychological damage later in life, and intersex rights campaigners broadly welcomed the ban in Germany.	Dipatlisiso di tshitshinya gore dikaro tse di sa tlhokegeng, tse di dirwang kwa ntle ga tumalano le bana, di ka baka tshenyo mo tlhaloganyong moragonyana mo botshelong, mme balweladitshwanelo tsa batho ba ba bonweng ka dirwe tsa bonna le tsa bosadi ba amogetse thibelo e kwa Germany.
We’re very happy that there is finally a law about this, but the ban has loopholes and leaves many questions unanswered, Charlotte Wunn, head of intersex rights group Intergeschlechtliche Menschen, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.	Re itumetse thata gore kwa bofelong, go na le molao ka ga seno, mme fela thibelo e, e na le diphatlha mme e tlogela dipotso di le dintsi di sena dikarabo, Charlotte Wunn, tlhogo ya setlhopha sa ditshwanelo tsa batho ba ba bonweng ba na le dirwe tsa bonna le tsa bosadi, Intergeschlechtliche Menschen, o boleletse setheo sa Thomson Reuters.
Parents and doctors could get around the new law and proceed with surgery by avoiding an intersex diagnosis, and the legislation does not stipulate penalties, Wunn and others said.	Batsadi le dingaka ba ka kgona go ya ka Molao o mošwa, mme ba  tswela pele ka karo ka go tila tlhatlhobo ya bong, le peomolao ga e a tlhomamisa dikwatlhao, go bua Wunn le ba bangwe.

According to a study by the University of Bochum, 1,871 children under the age of 10 underwent feminising or masculinising surgery between 2005 and 2016 in Germany, which joins Malta and Portugal in banning such procedures.

SABC News looks back at some COVID-19-related stories that left South Africans shocked and outraged since President Cyril Ramaphosa first announced what was supposed to be a 21-day lockdown on 23 March 2020.	Ba dikgang tsa SABC ba lebelela kwa morago go leba dikgang tsa COVID-19 tse di tlogetseng Maaforikaborwa a tshogile e bile a tenegile go tloga ka motsi o Moporesidente Cyril Ramaphosa o neng a dira kitsiso ya ntlha e e  neng e tshwanetse go nna matsatsi a le 21 fela a kiletsometsamao ka 23 Mopitlwe 2020.
It all started when the first case of COVID-19 in South African was detected in KwaZulu-Natal.	Tsotlhe di simolotse fa kgetse ya ntlha ya COVID-19 mo Aforikaborwa e ne e lemogwa kwa KwaZulu-Natal.
A 38-year-old man who had travelled to Italy on holiday with a group of 10 people tested positive for the virus.	Monna wa dingwaga yo o neng a etetse kwa Italy ka malatsing a boikhutso le setlhopha sa batho ba le 10, ba dirile diteko mme tsa kaya fa ba na le mogare.
Since then over 1.5 million South Africans have contracted the virus and there have been more than 50 000 COVID 19-related deaths.	Fa e sale ka nako eo, Maaforikaborwa a feta dimilione di le 1.5 ba tshwaeditswe ke mogare mme go na le dintsho di le 50 000 tse di tlhomamisitsweng.
Below are some of the regulations that sent tongues wagging and shocking incidents.	Fa tlase ke mengwe ya melawana e e galefisitseng batho le ditiragalo tse di gakgamatsang.
Ban on alcohol and cigarettes sales	Thibelo ya dithekiso tsa nnotagi le disekerete.
In what was described as one of the worlds strictest lockdowns, South Africa banned the sale of alcohol and tobacco products, saying it would compromise the health of citizens.	Mo go se se neng se tlhalosiwa jaaka nngwe ya melawana ya kiletsometsao e e gagametseng thata, Aforikaborwa e ne ya thibela thekiso ya nnotagi le dikumo tsa motsoko, e re di tlaa tsenya boitekanelo jwa baagi mo kotsing.
Citizens faced a five-month ban on the sale of cigarettes and three alcohol bans since the pandemic hit last March, the last was imposed on 28 December.	Baagi ba ne ba lebana le thibelo ya thekiso ya disekerete ya dikgwedi di le tlhano, le dithibelo di le tharo tsa thekiso ya nnotagi go tloga ka tshimologo ya leroborobo ka kgwedi ya Mopitlwe, ya bofelo e tswentswe tirisong ka di 28 Sedimonthole.
This sparked public outrage and resulted in the black market thriving with sales going up to more than double its market value.	Se se tsositse kgalefo mo bathong mme  dithekiso tse di seng ka fa molaong di tsa simolola go dira madi a mantsi, ba ne ba bona dipoelo tse fetang tsa kwa marekelong gabedi.
It, therefore, comes as no surprise that other top searches in South Africa for 2020 included searches such as how to make pineapple beer.	Ka jalo, ga  go makatse gore dipatlisiso tse dingwe tse di kwa godimo mo Aforikaborwa ka 2020 di akaretsa dipatlisisio tse di tshwanang le go dira bojalwa ka peinapole.
However, this proved fatal for some who died after the consumption of homemade alcohol or were rushed to hospital for poisoning.

During the hard lockdown, mothers were left frustrated after they couldn’t buy to buy clothes for their babies because of the nationwide lockdown.

Another bizarre COVID-19 regulation was that South African stores could only sell closed toe, shoes and short-sleeved shirts if they were promoted or displayed to be worn under jackets or jerseys.	Molao o mongwe wa COVID-19 o o neng o sa tlwaelesegang e ne e le gore mabenkele a Aforikaborwa a letleletswe go rekisa fela ditlhako tse di tswalegileng kwa pele le dihempe tsa matsogo a makhutshwane fa di etleediwa  kgotsa di aparwa ka ga tlase ga dibaki kgotsa dijeresi.
Soo Im on a ban from buying anymore baby clothes.	Ka jalo, ke thibetswe go reka diaparo tse dingwe tsa masea.
Thank God for online shopping	Re leboga Modimo gonne re kgona go reka ka kgolagano ya mafaratlhatlha.

Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it had blocked a group of hackers in China who used the platform to target Uighurs living abroad with links to malware that would infect their devices and enable surveillance.	Facebook Inc e rile ka Laboraro, e thibetse setlhopha sa batho ba ba tsenang mo dikhomputareng tsa batho kwa China, ba ba dirisitseng polatefomo e go tlhasela ma Uighur a a nnang kwa dinageng tsa kwa ntle ba ba nang le kgolagano le serweboleta sa thibotshenyo se se ka tshwaetsang  didirisiwa tsa bona mme sa letla gore ba kgone ba lebelela.
The social media company said the hackers, known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye in the security industry, targeted activists, journalists and dissidents who were predominantly Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic group facing persecution in China.	Setlamo sa media wa botsalano sa re batho ba ba tsenang mo dikhomputareng tsa batho, ba ba  itsegeng jaaka Earth Empusa kgotsa Evil Eye mo madirelong a pabalesego, ba tlhasetse balweladiphetogo le babegakgang ba e neng e le  diUighur, setlhopha se segolo sa morafe wa mamoseleme, se se neng se lebane le dipogiso kwa China.
Facebook said there were less than 500 targets, who were largely from the Xinjiang region but were primarily living abroad in countries including Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United States, Syria, Australia and Canada.	Facebook e rile go ne go na le batho ba ba tlhasetsweng ba palo ya bona e leng kwa tlase ga 500, ba ba tswang kwa kgaolong ya Xinjiang mme ba ne ba tshela kwa moseja, kwa dinageng tse di akaretsang Turkey, Kazakhstan, United States, Syria, Australia le Canada.
It said the majority of the hackers activity occurred away from Facebook and that they used the site to share links to malicious websites rather than directly sharing the malware on the platform.	E rile bontsi jwa tiro ya batho ba ba tsenang mo dikhomputareng tsa batho e diragetse kwa ntle ga Facebook le gore ba dirisitse webosaete go neelana ka tsela ya go tsena mo diwebosaeteng tse di sa siamang, gona le gore ba abelane ka serwebololeta sa thibotshenyo ka tlhamalalo mo polatefomong.
This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while obfuscating who’s behind it, Facebook cybersecurity investigators said in a blog post.

Facebook said the hacking group used fake Facebook accounts to pose as fictitious journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the Uighur community to build trust with their targets and trick them into clicking malicious links that would install spying software on their devices.	Facebook ya re setlhopha sa batho ba ba tsenang mo dikhomputareng tsa batho se dirisitse diakhaonto tsa Facebook tsa mokokotelo go dira jaaka e kete ke babegadikgang, baithuti, balwela ditshwanelo tsa batho kgotsa ditokololo tsa baagi ba Uighur go aga boikanyego le bona mme morago ba ba tsietse gore ba tobetse di linke tse di tlaa tsenyang dirweboletsa tsa go tlhola mo didirisweng tsa bona.
It said hackers both set up malicious websites using look-alike domains for popular Uighur and Turkish news sites and compromised legitimate websites visited by the targets.	E rile, batho ba ba tsenang mo dikhomputareng tsa batho ba aga diwebosaete tse di sa siamang ka go dirisa diwebosaete tse di batlileng di tshwana le tse di itsegeng thata tsa dikgang tsa, Uighur, le Turkey mme gape ba senya diwebosaete tse di mo molaong tse di etelwang ke batho ba ba ikaeletseng go ba tlhasela.
Facebook also found websites created by the group to mimic third-party Android app stores with Uighur-themed apps, like a prayer app and dictionary app, containing malware.

Black South Africans were more willing to sacrifice their rights to stop the spread of the coronavirus, than their white counterparts.	MaAforikaborwa ba bantsho ba ne ba dumela go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa bona setlhabelo  go thibela kanamo ya mogare wa corona, go na le  basweu.
This is according to the Human Sciences and Research Council (HSRC) in a study conducted during the lockdown in 2020.	Se ke ke go ya ka khansele ya Disaense tsa Setho le Patlisiso (Council (HSRC) mo patlisisong e e dirilweng ka nako ya kiletsometsamo ka 2020.
The HSRC released the findings of its research titled: Who is willing to sacrifice human rights in the context of COVID in a webinar in Pretoria.	HSRC e golotse diphitlhelelo tsa dipatlisiso tse setlhogo sa yona e reng: Ke mang yo o ratang go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa gagwe tsa botho setlhabelo mo bokaong jwa COVID, mo bobinareng kwa Pretoria.
The findings come as the country is about to mark one year since the lockdown was instituted to curb the spread of COVID-19.	Diphitlhelelo tse di tla nako e naga e tshwayang ngwaga fa e sale go tsenngwa tirisong melawana ya kiletsometsamao  go thibela go anama ga COVID-19.
National Assembly focuses on how COVID-19 affected the rights of South Africans.	Kokoano ya bosetšhaba e tlhoma mogopolo mo ditseleng tse ka tsona COVID-19 e amileng ditshwanelo tsa Maaforikaborwa.
The study was conducted in three phases: April to May; August to October; and December 2020 to January 2021.	Patlisiso e e ne e dirwa ka dikgato di le tharo: Moranang go fitlha ka Motsheganong; Phatwe le Diphalane; le Sedimonthole 2020 go fitlha ka Ferikgong 2021.
The HSRCs Divisional Research Executive Professor Narnia Bohler-Muller says, 78% of South Africans were willing to sacrifice their human rights to stop the spread of the virus.	Khuduthamaga ya lephata la dipatlisiso kwa HSRC Moporofesara Narnia Bohler-Muller a re, 78% ya Maaforikaborwa ba ne ba batla go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa bona tsa botho setlhabelo go thibela go anama ga mogare.
So, 78% in the third round	Ka jalo, 78% mo legatong la boraro.
So, there wasn’t much difference across the rounds as to this general question that is: are you willing to sacrifice your rights?	Ka jalo, go ne go sena pharologano e kalo mo magatong fa go tliwa mo potsong e e reng: a o dumela go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa gago setlhabelo.
But where we broke down to which rights you were willing to sacrifice, then the outcomes were slightly different.	Mme fa re e kgaoganya ka gore: ke ditshwanelo dife tse o batlang go dintsha setlhabelo, dipoelo di ne di farologana go le gonnye.
Demographics:	Palo ya batho
Prof Bohler-Muller says according to demographics, it has been found that black South Africans were more willing to sacrifice their rights to stop the spread of the virus compared to their white counterparts.	Mop Bohler-Muller a re go ya ka palo ya batho, go fitlhetswe gore bantsho ba Aforikaborwa ba ne ba dumela go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa bona setlhabelo go thibela go anama ga mogare fa go bapisiwa le basweu.
The most demographic group, most willing to sacrifice their rights were black South Africans at 81%.	Bontsi jwa batho ba ba neng ba ikemiseditse go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa bona setlhabelo e ne e le bantsho ba Aforikaborwa ka 81%.
The demographic in South Africa that were least willing to sacrifice their rights were white South Africans at 58%.	Palo ya batho mo Aforikaborwa e e neng e sa ikemisetsa go ntsha ditshwanelo tsa bona setlhabelo e ne e le basweu ba Aforikaborwa ka 58%.
Chief Executive Officer of the South African Human Rights Commission, Advocate Tseliso Thipanyane, says the commission has seen an increase in the number of complaints of human rights violations during the lockdown.	Motlhankedimogolo wa Khomišene ya Ditshwanelo tsa Botho ya Aforikaborwa, Mmueledi Tseliso Thipanyane a re, Khomišene e bone tlhatlogo ya palo ya dingongorego tsa dikgatako tsa ditshwanelo tsa botho ka nako ya kiletso metsamao.
So yes, the number of complaints did increase because of the peculiar nature of COVID-19 that we are now limiting the rights.	Ee, palo ya dingongorego e ne ya oketsega ka ntlha ya mofuta wa bolwetse o COVID-19 e leng ona, jaanong re lekanyetsa ditshwanelo tsa botho.
The other thing which concerns us, which we are also looking at under small offences; what might happen to people who got the criminal record for not wearing a mask because then are you going to have a policy where after a certain period of time, those records will be expunged?	Sengwe gape se se re tshwenyang, se re se lebeletseng ka fa tlase ga ditlolomolao tse di nnye; ke eng se se ka diragalang go batho ba ba nang le rekoto ya bosenyi ka ntlha ya go se apare maseke, a o tlile go nna le pholisi e e tla reng kwa morago ga nako e e beilweng, direkoto tseo di tloswe?.
Human Rights and Social Justice Activist, Mark Heywood, says respect for and promotion of human rights will improve the country’s COVID-19 response.	Molweladiphetogo wa ditshwanelo tsa Botho le bosiamisi jwa loago, Mark Heywood a re tlotlo ya, le go rotloetsa ditshwanelo tsa botho go tlaa tokafatsa tsibogo ya naga ya COVID-19.
So there is a positive side that has to be much better understood.	Ka jalo go na le letlhakore le le siameng le le tshwanetseng go tlhaloganngwa botoka.
There is positive state obligation when it comes to socio-economic rights whose regression makes people more vulnerable to COVID-19, to spreading COVID-19 and to dying of COVID-19.	Go na le maikarabelo a a siameng a puso fa go tliwa mo ditshwanelong tsa ikonomi le loago batho tse poelo morago ya tsona e dirang gore batho ba iphitlhele ba tsenwa ke COVID-19 botlhofo, go phasalatsa COVID-19 le go tlhokafala ka ntlha ya COVID-19.
The HSRC and the Human Rights Commission say, despite, there being important players in research and protection of human rights, the national Coronavirus Command Council, chaired by President Cyril Ramaphosa, has never invited them to give input on how to deal with COVID-19.	HSRC le Khomišene ya Ditshwanelo tsa botho, ya re, le fa go na le batsayakarolo ba ba botlhokwa mo patlisisong le tshireletso ya ditshwanelo tsa botho, khansele ya bosetšhaba ya mogare wa corona, e modulasetulo wa yona e leng moporesitente Cyril Ramaphosa, ga e ise e ba laletse go neelana ka tshwaelo ka ga tsela ya go samagana le COVID-19.
The right to go to place of worship was the right South Africans were most willing to sacrifice.	Tshwanelo ya go ya kwa mafelong a kobamelo, ke tshwanelo e Maaforikaborwa a le mantsi a neng a ikemiseditse go e ntsha setlhabelo.

They’re in a way violated because when they walk in the streets, they’re vulnerable to being robbed of their belongings.	Di a gatakakiwa ka tsela e e rileng ka ntlha ya gore fa ba tsamaya mo mebileng, ba nna mo kotsing ya go tshwarwa poo le go tseelwa dithoto tsa bona.
We also provide them with skills on how to deal with challenges in relation to what could happen in their private spaces.	Gape re ba tlamela ka bokgoni jwa go samagana le dikgwetlho tse di mabapi le se se ka ba diragagelang mo poraefeteng.
The province needs to build 487 libraries in order for all communities to have access to books and information.	Porofense e tshwanetse go aga dilaeborari di le 487 gore baagi botlhe ba kgone go nna le phitlhelelo ya dibuka le tshedimosetso.

The movie, directed and written by Adam Mason and with KJ Apa and Sofia Carson in the leads, is set three years into the future where attempts at a vaccine against COVID-23 have failed, the virus has mutated, and comes back stronger and deadlier.

United States President Joe Biden says his rescue dog, a German Shepherd named Major, is being trained after an incident last week, but has not been banished from the White House, adding the pet is still adjusting to life there surrounded by strangers.	Moporesitente wa United States, Joe Biden a re ntšwa ya gagwe, modisa wa mojeremane, e e bidiwang Major, e a katisiwa morago ga tiragalo ya beke e e fetileng, mme ga e ise e lelekiwe ka pateletso kwa White House, a tlaleletsa ka gore seruiwa se santse se itlwaetsa botshelo jwa go di dikaganyediwa ke batho ba se se sa ba itseng.
Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin, Biden told the ABC programme Good Morning America in an interview that aired on Wednesday.	Major ga a loma mongwe le go tsenelela mo letlalong, Biden o boleletse lenaneo la ABC la Good Morning Amerika mo dipotsolotsong tswe di gasitsweng ka Laboraro.
You turn the corner and there’s two people you don’t know at all and they move, and he moves to protect, Biden added, referring to US Secret Service and other staff who the German Shepherd encounters at the 18-acre (7-hectare)White House complex.	Fa o re o a lebelela o bona batho ba le babedi ba o sa ba itseng, mme ene tiro ya gagwre ke go sireletsa, Biden a tlaleletsa a buela mo badiring ba sephiri ba kwa US le ba bangwe ba modisa yo wa Mojerewane a kopanang le bona  kwa 18-Acre (diheketara di le7) kwa White House.

The dog’s being trained now, I didn’t banish him to home in Delaware, Biden added.	Ntšwa e e a katisiwa jaanong. Ga ke a e lelekela kwa gae kwa Delaware, Biden a tlaleletsa.
The White House last week said the dog had returned to Bidens home state while the president and first lady Jill Biden were traveling but did not directly address media reports of an incident involving security staff.

After gifting and selling tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses abroad, India suddenly finds itself short of shots as new infections surge in the world’s second-most populous country.	Morago ga go neela le go rekisa dimilione tsa moento wa Khorona-19, naga ya India e iphitlhela e tlhaela meento fa palo e ntšhwa ya ditshwaetsego e oketsega mo nageng ya bobedi e e nang le baagi ba le bantsi.
India breached 200 000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.	India e fitlheletse ditshwaetsego di le kana ka 200 000 lwa ntlha ka Labone, mme e leka go enta baagi ba yona ka go dirisa meento ya mo nageng.
Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drug-makers like Pfizer.	Go bona dipalopalo di oketsega le tshologo ya bontsintsi jwa balwetse kwa maokelong morago ga gore tetlelelo ya metsamao e fokodiwe, se se dirile gore go nne le phetogo ya melawana ya go dumelela go tlisiwa ga meento ka potlako morago ga go kgapelwa kwa thoko ga badiri ba melemo jaaka Pfizer.
It will import Russia Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.	E tla amogela moento wa kwa Russia wa Sputnik V go simolola ka kgwedi e go fitlhelela batho ba ka nna dimilione di le 125.
The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India’s battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.	Pusetso morago ya matlole e ka kgoreletsa e seng fela ntwa ya  kwa India ya go fedisa mogare, mme gape le matsholo a meento mo dinageng tse di humanegileng tse di fetang 60, bogolosegolo mo Aforika, ka dikgwedi di le dintsi.
The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organisation and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asias pharmaceutical powerhouse.	Lenaneo la COVAX, le tshegeditswe ke Mokgatlho wa Lefatshe wa Boitekanelo le moento wa Gavi, le ikaelela go lekalekanya phitlhelelo ya moento mo lefatsheng ka bophara, mme e ikaegile thata mo go dirisiwa go tswa kwa India, khemisi e e kgolo ya melemo ya kwa Asia.
So far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses.	Go fitlha ka kgwedi e, naga ya India e rometse meento e ka nna dimilione di le 1.2 fela.
An official with knowledge of India’s vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an emergency situation.	Motlhankedi yo o nang le kitso ya moento wa kwa India o rile meento e e leng teng  e tlaa dirisiwa mo nageng ya rona le fa naga ya rona e lebagane le maemo a tshoganyetso.
There is no commitment to other countries, he said.	Ga gona boitlamo go tswa mo dinageng tse dingwe, o rile jalo.
India’s foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.	Lefapha la Merero ya Boditšhaba la India, le le okamelang ditumalano tsa meento le dinaga tse dingwe, le rile mo beke e e fetileng gore tlhokego ya kwa India e tla laola boemo jwa thomelontle.
Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a UN health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.	Tlhogego e setse e bonagala mo mafatsheng a mangwe mo sekemeng sa Covax, mme motlhankedi wa tsa boitekanelo wa UN yo o amegang mo go ntshetshiweng ga meento mo Aforikaborwa o rile: Go nna o ikageli mo motlameding a le mongwe go baka matshwenyego a magolo.
The director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be catastrophic.	Mokaedi wa Disenthara tsa Afrorika tsa Taolo le Thibelo ya Malwetse, John Nkengasong, o rile mo tshimologong ya kgwedi gore tiego ya  ditlamelo go tswa kwa India e ka baka matlhotlhapelo.
Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.	Metswedi e le mene e e nang le seabe mo dipuisanong tsa melemo le tshenkelo e rile, dintlha tse di akaretsang tiego kwa India le Covax ya go tsenya diotara, tlhokego ya peeletso, tlhaelo ya didiriswa tse di tala, mmogo le go sa tseye tsia mogare wa khorona kwa gae, go nnile le seabe mo tlhatlogong ya go tlhaela ga moento.
The Serum Institute of India (SII), the worlds biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.	Setheo sa Serum sa India (SII), badiri ba ba golo thata mo lefatsheng ba moento, se dirile maikano a go neelana ka meento ya COVID-19 e ka nnang kana ka dibilione di le 2 go dinaga tsa letseno le le kwa tlase le le le mo magareng, ka bokana ka halofo bo tlaa fitlhelelwa fa ngwaga wa 2021 o ya kwa bokhutlong.
It has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca’s global production problems.	E nnile gape mo tlase ga kgatelelo ya go fitlhelela ditlhokego tsa dipuso tse dingwe, go akaretsa Britain, Canada le Saudi Arabia, magareng ga mathata a lefatshe ka bophara a go dira moento wa AstraZeneca.
A further initial hurdle to SIIs supply ambitions was India’s hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.	Ntlha e nngwe e e kgoreletsang maikalelo a ditlamelo a SIIS, ke ketsaetsego e India e nnileng le yona mo go tsenyeng dipeeletso tse di tsepameng, go bua metswedi e mebedi.
That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.	Se, se kabo se e letleletse go oketsa kungo ya moento wa AstraZeneca nako e sale teng, le fa batho ba ba bayang melao ba ne ba ise ba e amogele.
India spent months discussing the final price per dose and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after Indias drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.	India nako ya dikgwedi tse di ka tlhotlhwa e e ka nang le taolo ya go reka inked e e ka nnang dibeke di le pedi morago ga go amogela astrazeneca indias seritibatsi sa go laola, go ya ka metswedi.
At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.	Mo ntlheng e e rileng, SII e feletswe ke leflo la go boloka meento.
That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house, SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.	Ke ka moo ke tlhophileng gore ke seka ka paka meento e e fetang dimilione di le 50, ka gonne ke ne ke itse gore fa nka paka go feta moo, ke tlaa tshwanelwa ke go e boloka kwa ntlong ya me, Mokhuduthamaga wa SIIU Adar Poonawalla o boleletse Reuters ka Ferikgong.
He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.	O rile o dirisitse dibilione tse 20 rupees ($272, milione) go reka meento e le dimilione di le 50, tse setlamo se simolotseng go e kgobokanya go tloga ka kgwedi ya Diphalane.
Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.	Le jaanong, puso e reka ditlamelo tsa nakwana go tswa kwa SIIU mo boemong jwa go tlamela ka thulaganyo ya paka telele, go buile mongwe wa metswedi.
SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.	SII e kopile dimilione di le $400 go tswa kwa pusong go oketsa bokgoni, mme ga go na boitlamo bope jo bo dirilweng.
The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of Indias vaccination rollout.	Lefapha la Pholo le Lefapha la Merero ya Boditšhaba ga le a tsibogela dikopo tsa go tshwaela ka ga merero ya matlole, tiego ya ditheko le dintlha tse dingwe tsa go ntsha moento kwa India.
COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.	Gape COVAX ga e a neelana ka tetla ya thomelo go dinaga tse di tsayang karolo mo SII go fitlha morago ga gore moento o amogelwe ke WHO fa kgwedi ya Tlhakole e le mo magareng, go buile motswedi o o amegang mo letsholong la COVAX.
The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.	Motswedi o o rile tiego e, e kaya gore dimilione tsa meento e e tlaleletsang e e kabong e dirilwe fa gare ga kgwedi ya Diphalane le Tlhakole, ga e a dirwa.
Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders.	Gavi e sireleditse tshwetso ya bona ya go emela tetla e e tshwanetseng pele ba ka tswela pele ka dipeeletso tse di tsepameng.
And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India’s vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.	Le fa e ntse e batlana le batlamedi ba bangwe, e amogetse gore dilo di le dintsi di santse di ikaegile ka badiri ba meento ba kwa India, ba ba tlamelang ka 60% ya meento lefatshe ka bophara.
COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII.	COVAX e dirile ditumalano tsa go reka meento e e ka fetang bilione e le 1 go tswa kwa SII.
But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May.	Fela e e amogetsweng kwa tlase ga botlhano ya dimilione di le 100 kgotsa ka jalo di ntse a sii-made astrazeneca moento go ne go solofetswe ka Motsheganong.
SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot for COVAX.	SII gape e tshwanetse go dira dimilione tsa meento ya Novavax ya COVAX.
Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India’s COVID-19 crisis could affect that.	Gavi e ne e  solofetse  gore SII e tlaa tswelela go gorosa meento ya COVAX ka Motsheganong, mme ka Laboraro, e rile mathata a kwa India a COVID-19 a ka ama se.
We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible, it said in an email to Reuters.	Re tlhaloganya bosetlhogo jwa mogare mo India ka nako ya jaanong, le fa go le jalo re solofela go amogela ditlamelo ka bonako jo bo kgonegang, e buile mo emailing e e e romeletseng Reuters.
On Thursday India reported 200 739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1 038 deaths took its toll to 173 123.	Ka Labone, India e begile dikgetse di le 200 739 tsa tshwaetsego mo diureng di le 24 tse di fetileng, rekoto ya bosupa ya letsatsi le letsatsi mo malatsing a le robedi, fa dintsho di le 1 038 di isitse palogotlhe ya dintsho go 173 123.
Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.	Palogotlhe ya ditshwaetsego di le dimilione di le 14.1 e ama United States fela.
Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.	Le fa ba ne ba na le maikaelelo a go fitlhelela batho ba ba leng mo kotsing ba le dimilione di le 300, kgotsa go feta botlhano jwa baagi ba le dibilione di le 1.35 ka kgwedi ya Phatwe, , puso jaanong e atolositse palo e ka dimilione di le 100, ka tsholofetso ya go e oketsa go ya pele.
The United States is preparing for the possibility that a booster shot will be needed between nine to 12 months after people are initially vaccinated against COVID-19, a White House official said on Thursday.	United States e ipaakanyetsa kgonagalo ya gore go ka nna le tlhokego ya moento o mongwe gape magareng ga dikgwedi di le robongwe go ya go di le 12 morago ga gore batho ba entiwe kgatlhanong le COVID-19, modiredi wa White House o buile jalo ka Labone.
While the duration of immunity after vaccination is being studied, booster vaccines could be needed, David Kessler, chief science officer for President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 response task force told a congressional committee meeting.	Le fa bokgoni jwa mmele jwa go itwela kgatlhanong le malwetse morago ga moento bo santse bo le ka fa tlase ga dipatlisiso, moento o mongwe mo godimo ga oo o ka tswa o tlhokega, David Kessler, Motlhankedimogolo wa saense wa setlhopha sa COVID-19 sa ga Moporesitente Joe Biden o boleletse Komiti ya khonkerese kwa kopanong.
The current thinking is those who are more vulnerable will have to go first, he said.	Monagano wa jaanong jaana ke gore, ba o ba leng mo kotsing ba tlaa tshwanelwa ke go ya pele, o ne a bolela jalo.
Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla said people will likely need a third booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines within 12 months and could need annual shots, CNBC reported based on his comments from April 1, which were made public on Thursday.	Re sa ntse re le foo, Mokhuduthamaga wa Pfizer, Albert Bourla a re batho ba ka tlhoka moento wa boraro wa COVID-19 mo dikgweding di le 12 mme gape ba ka tlhoka go entiwa ngwaga le ngwaga, CNBC e begile e lebisitse mo ditshwaelong tsa gagwe go tloga ka Moranang 1, tse di phasaladitsweng ka Labone.
Initial data has shown that vaccines from Moderna Inc and partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE retain most of their effectiveness for at least six months, though for how much longer has not been determined.	Tshedimosetso e bontshitse gore meento e e tswang kwa Moderna Inc & Partners, Pfizer Inc le BioNTech SE e tlamela ka tshireletso ya dikgwedi di le thataro, le fa go ise go tlhomamisiwe gore go fitlha leng.
Even if that protection lasts far longer than six months, experts have said that rapidly spreading variants of the coronavirus and others that may emerge could lead to the need for regular booster shots similar to annual flu shots.	Le fa e le gore tshireletsego eo e nna go feta dikgwedi tse thataro, baitseanape ka kaile gore megare e mengwe ya khorona e e phasalatsegang ka bonako, le e mengwe e e ka tlhagogang, e ka dira gore batho ba tlhoke go entiwa nako le nako go tshwana le fa ba tsaya moento wa sefuba ngwaga le ngwaga.
The United States is also tracking infections in people who have been fully vaccinated, Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention told the House subcommittee hearing.	United States e ntse gape e sala morago ditshwaetsego mo bathong ba ba entileng ka botlalo, Rochelle Walensky, Mokaedi wa Senthara ya go laola le go thibela malwetse kwa US o boleletse komitipotlana ya ntlo ya theetso.
Of 77 million people vaccinated in the United States, there have been 5 800 such breakthrough infections, Walensky said, including 396 people who required hospitalisation and 74 who died.	Go batho ba le dimilione di le 77 ba ba entileng kwa United States, go nnile le diphitlhelelo tsa go nna jalo di le 5 800, Walensky o buile jalo, go akaretsa batho ba le 396 ba ba neng ba tlhoka go isiwa kwa bookelong le ba le 74 ba ba tlhokafetseng.
Walensky said some of these infections have occurred because the vaccinated person did not mount a strong immune response.	Walensky o rile dingwe tsa ditshwaetso tse di diragetse ka gonne mmele wa motho yo o entileng o sa kgona go lwantsha malwetse.
But the concern is that in some cases, they are occurring in people infected by more contagious virus variants.	Fela matshwenyego ke gore mo mabakeng a mangwe, di diragala mo bathong ba ba tshwaeditsweng ke megare e e farologaneng e e kotsi.
Earlier this month, Pfizer and partner BioNTech said their vaccine was around 91% effective in preventing COVID-19, citing updated trial data that included more than 12 000 people fully inoculated for at least six months.	Mo tshimologong ya kgwedi e, Pfizer le modirammogo le yona, BioNTech ba rile moento wa bona o na le diperesente di le 90 tsa go thibela COVID-19, ba nopola tshedimosetso ya diteko e e tlhabolotsweng, e e akaretsang batho ba ba fetang 12 000 ba ba tlhabilweng ka botlalo mo nakong ya dikgwedi di le thataro.
Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease doctor, hopes US regulators will make a quick decision to lift a pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and get that vaccine back on track, he said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.	Anthony Fauci, ngaka ya maemo a a kwa godimo ya malwetse a a tshelanwang, o solofela gore badiramelao ba kwa US ba tlaa tsaya tshwetso ya ka bonako ya go tsholetsa kgaotso ya moento wa Johnson & Johnson le go o  busetsa mo tirisong, o buile jalo mo potsolotsong le Reuters ka Labone.
His comments come a day after a panel of advisers to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) delayed a vote on whether to resume the J&J shots for at least a week, until it had more data on the risk.	Ditshwaelo tsa gagwe di tla letsatsi morago ga phanele ya bagakolodi ba senthara ya go laola malwetse le thibelo (CDC) ba diegisitse boutu ya go tswelela ka moento wa J & J mo bekeng eo, go fitlhelela e  nna le tshedimosetso e nngwe gape ka ga bokotsi jwa yona.
The United States earlier this week decided to pause distribution of the J&J vaccine to investigate six cases of a rare brain blood clot linked with low platelet counts in the blood.	United States go sale gale mo bekeng eno, e sweditse go kgaotsa kabelo ya moento wa J & J, go batlisisa dikgetse di le thataro tsa tsa go rema ga madi mo bobokong, e e golaganngwang le  polatelete e e kwa tlase mo mading.
Fauci said the pause was an indication that the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration take safety very seriously.	Fauci o rile kgaotso e ne e le sesupo sa gore CDC le tsamaiso ya dijo le diritibatsi di tsaya tshireletsego ka tlhoafalo.
I hope they make the conclusion of this quickly, and get back on track, he said.	Ke solofela gore ba tlaa tsaya tshwetso ya ka bonako mo go se, mme ba boele mo tseleng, o buile jalo.
And I believe they will.	Mme ke dumela gore ba tlaa dira jalo.
Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said he worried about the effects of a prolonged delay.	Fauci, yo e leng Mokaedi wa Setheo sa Bosetšhaba sa aleji le malwetse a a tshelanwang le mogakolodi wa tsa kalafi wa kwa White House, a re o ne a tshwenyegile ka ga ditlamorago tsa go diegisiwa nako e telele.
The concern is that the longer you draw it out, the more there will be concern about not only that vaccine but it might even have an impact on vaccine hesitancy in general, he said.	Tlhobaelo ke gore fa e diegisiwa nako e e telele, ke moo go tlaa nnang le matshwenyego, e seng fela ka ga moento mme e ka baka go okaoka ka ga moento ka kakaretso, o buile jalo.
Once back on track he said, I think we’ve just got to continue to emphasize that this is a very efficacious vaccine and could be used, and be very, very valuable on the global scene.	Fa e setse e boetse mo tseleng, a re, ke akanya gore re tshwanetse go tswelela ka go gatelela gore ke moento o o nang le bokgoni thata mme o ka dirisiwa, e bile o ka nna le boleng jo bo kwa godimo thata mo lefatsheng ka bophara.
The blood clots associated with the J&J vaccine bear close resemblance to cases seen in Europe with the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, and some countries in Europe are already backing away from using both.	Go rema ga madi go go amanangwang le moento wa J & J, go batla go tshwana le dikgetse tse di bonweng kwa Europe ka moento wa AstraZeneca PLC, mme dinaga tse dingwe kwa Europe di setse di simolotse go ikgatholosa go dirisa meento e ka bobedi.
Denmark on Wednesday announced it would stop using AstraZenecas vaccine altogether.	Denmark ka Laboraro e dirile kitsiso ya gore e tlaa emisa go dirisa moento o o AstraZenecas gotlhelele.
Asked if such moves may be premature, Fauci said, I think in many respects it is, at least until countries find out whether or not the events are truly occurring at a higher rate than would normally occur in the population.	Fa a bodiwa gore a dikgato tseo di tswere pele ga nako kgotsa jang, Fauci o rile, ke akanya gore mo mabekeng a mantsi go ntse jalo, bobotlana go fitlhelela dinaga di lemoga gore a ditiragalo tse di diragala ka kelo e e kwa godimo go feta ka mokgwa wa gale mo baaging.
The blood clots have not been seen with the Moderna Inc and the BioNTech/Pfizer Inc vaccines, which are made using a different type of technology called mRNA.	Go rema ga madi ga go ise bonwe ka tiriso ya meento ya Moderna Inc le ya BioNTech/Pfizer Inc, tse di dirilweng ka go dirisa mefuta e e farologaneng ya thekenoloji e e bidiwang mRNA.
Fauci said countries that do not have other options may have to weigh the risks of the vaccine versus the risk of COVID-19, which has also been linked with the same type of brain blood clots.	Fauci o rile, dinaga tse di se nang meento e mengwe di tlaa tshwanelwa ke go tlhola bokotsi jwa moento kgatlhanong le matshosetsi a COVID-19, e le yona e golagantsweng le mofuta o o tshwanang wa go rema ga madi mo bobokong.
If you have alternative vaccines, fine, but if you don’t, you may need to say you know, it’s a very, very small risk, he said.	Fa o na le meento e mengwe, go siame, mme fa o sena yona, o ka tlhoka go bua ka gore o a itse, ke kotsi e nnye thata, o buile jalo.
That will be a judgment call that will be made in the future.	Seo e tlaa nna kopo ya katlholo e e tlaa dirwang mo isagweng.

Four people died in Italy from rare blood clots after they received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, a report from the AIFA national pharmaceutical agency said on Thursday.	Batho ba le bane ba tlhokafetse kwa Italy ka ntlha ya go rema ga madi morago ga go amogela moento wa COVID-19 wa AstraZeneca, pegelo go tswa kwa khemising ya bosetšhaba ya AIFA  e rile jalo ka Labone.
The AIFA report said various side-effects were seen following 0.5% of the 9.07 million doses administered between December 27 and March 26, with all three vaccines so far used, by manufacturers Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna, reported to have triggered unwelcome reactions.	Pegelo ya AIFA ya re ditlamorago tse di farologaneng di ne tsa bonwa morago ga go dirisiwa ga diperesente di le 0.5 tsa meento e le dimilione di le 9.07 e e tserweng fa gare ga di 27 tsa kgwedi ya Sedimonthole le di 26 tsa kgwedi ya Mopitlwe, go fitlha ga jaana, go setse go dirisitswe meento yotlhe ka boraro jwa yona e e e dirilweng ke Pfizer, AstraZenecale Moderna, e e kailweng go nna le matswela a a sa amogelesegang.
Severe side-effects were registered in 0.04% of cases.	Ditlamorago tse di masisi di kwadisitswe mo dikgetseng di le 0.04%.
Mild side-effects have been reported after use of all three vaccines, the AIFA report said, adding most involved flu-like symptoms, pain in the injection site and tiredness.	Matshwao a a botsatsa a begilwe morago ga tiriso ya meento e meraro e, pegelo ya AIFA e buile jalo,  bontsi jwa matshwao a a tlhagelelang a akaretsa sefuba, setlhabi mo lefelong la tlhabo le letsapa.
Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations last month when blood clot concerns surfaced.	Jaaka dinaga tse dintsi tsa kwa Europe, Italy e emisitse ka boripana meento ya AstraZeneca mo kgweding e e fetileng fa matshwenyego a go rema ga madi a sena go tlhagelela.
It has since resumed them for those aged 60 and above after EU regulators said the benefits outweighed the risks.	E boetse gape e tswelela ka yona go ba dingwaga di le 60 le go feta, morago ga gore balaodi ba EU ba kaye fa mesola ya yona e feta bokotsi jwa yona.
AIFA said there had been 11 cases in Italy of people developing one of two types of blood clots following their AstraZeneca shot cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and thrombosis involving multiple blood vessels.	AIFA e rile go na le dikgetse di le 11 kwa Italy, tsa batho ba ba itemogelang mefuta e mebedi ya go rema ga madi morago ga go tsaya moento wa le malwetse a mangwe a a akaretsang ditshika tse di farologaneng tsa madi.
Four of the 11 died, it said.	Ba le bane mo go ba le 11 ba tlhokafetse, e rile jalo.
AstraZeneca has said it is working to understand individual cases and possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events.	AstraZeneca e rile e leka go tlhaloganya dikgetse go ya batho ba ba farologaneng le ditsela tse di ka kgonang go tlhalosa ditiragalo tse di sa tlwaelegang tse.

Carhart-Harris warned that while these findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine were encouraging, patients with depression should not try to self-medicate with magic mushrooms.	Carhart-Harris o tsibositse gore le fa diphitlhelelo tse di phasaladitsweng mo jenaleng ya melemo ya kwa England di ne di rotloetsa, balwetse ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa kgatelelo ya maikutlo ga ba a tshwanela go leka go ithekela melemo ka bobona.
That would be an error of judgment, he said.	Seo e tlaa nna phoso ya katlholo, a rialo.
The research involved 59 patients with moderate to severe depression who got either a high dose of psilocybin and a placebo, or escitalopram plus a dose of psilocybin so low as to be classed as non-active and unlikely to have an effect.	Dipatlisiso di akareditse balwetse ba le 59 ba ba nang le matshwao a a mo bogareng le a a kwa godimo a kgatelelo ya maikutlo, ba ba amogetseng melemo ya psilocybin le placebo, kgotsa escitalopram e e nang le psilocybin e e kwa tlase e e se kitlang e nna matswela.

The Co-Chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19, Barry Schoub, has sought to explain potential reasons behind the rare occurrence of blood clots forming following the administering of a vaccine.	Motlatsamodulasetulo wa Komiti ya Bodiredi ya COVID-19, Barry Schoub, o lekile go tlhalosa mabaka a a ka nnang teng, a a bakang tiragalo ya go rema ga madi e e latelang morago ga go tsaya moento.
This after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)said that six cases of rare blood clotting were detected, following the rollout of more than6.8million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.	Se, se latela morago ga gore tsamaiso ya dijo le diritibatsi ya kwa US (FDA) e kaye gore go fitlhetswe dikgetse di le thataro tse di kgethegileng tsa go rema ga madi, go latela go ntshiwa ga meento ya Johnson & Johnson e e fetang dimilione di le 6.8.
South Africa has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country.	Aforikaborwa le yona e emisitse tiriso ya yona, le fa e le gore ga go dikgetse tsa go rema ga madi tse di begilweng mo nageng.
Nearly 300000 healthcare workers have already received the one-shot vaccine in SA.	Badiri ba tlhokomelo ya boitekanelo ba ka nna 300000 ba setse ba amogetse moento e le mongwe mo Aforikaborwa.
Schoub says investigations are ongoing to determine whether there is the possibility of the vaccine causing blood clots.	Schoub a re dipatlisiso di tsweletse go tlhomamisa gore a go na le kgonego ya gore moento o baka go rema ga madi.
There is the one thing that is being investigated, both the AstraZeneca and J&J are using what is called the Adenovirus vector, which is fairly harmless and is quite prevalent and that is used to carry the gene, or the vector, which is used to stimulate the immune response for protection.	Go na le selo se le sengwe se se batlisisiwang, AstraZeneca le J & J ba dirisa se se bidiwang Adenovirus vector, e e se nang bokotsi bope mme e e itsegeng thata e bile e dirisetswa go rwala jini, kgotsa veketara, e e dirisiwang go etleetsa a tsibogo ya tshireletso.
It is that particular vector that seeks to carry the Adenovirus which is being looked at.	Ke yona veketara e e rileng eo, e e batlang go rwala Adenovirus e e lebeletsweng.
Could that possibly be what is triggering these clots?	A se e ka nna sona se se dirang gore go nne le go rema ga madi?
But I must emphasize that at this stage, there is no evidence that these clots are related to the vaccine.	Mme ke tshwanetse go gatelela gore mo nakong eno, ga go na bosupi jwa gore go rema ga madi go amana le moento.
This is just something that is being investigated at the moment.	Se ke sengwe fela se se batlisisiwang ka nako e.

Based on their advice, we have determined to voluntarily suspend our rollout until the causal relationship between the development of clots and the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is sufficiently interrogated, he adds.	Re ikaegilwe ka kgakololo ya bona, re tsere tshwetso ya emisa nakwana go ntshiwa ga moento go fitlhelela kamano fa gare ga go baka go rema ga madi moento wa le Johnson & Johnson di botsolotswa mo go utlwalang, a tlaleletsa.
Mkhize says the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) will gather information from J&J, FDA and other regulatory bodies to thoroughly assess the situation before advising government regarding the vaccine.

She, together with a group of foreign nationals, were allowed to vaccinate in Beijing this week.	Ena, mmogo le setlhopha sa baditšhaba, ba ne ba letlelewa go enta kwa Beijing mo bekeng eno.
Zanele says the process was simple and efficient.	Zanele re thulaganyo e ne e le bonolo mme e nonofile.
It started with just confirming your information, checking your social security card, where they took down all your details.	E simolotse ka go netefatsa tshedimosetso ya gago, go netefatsa karata ya gago ya tshireletso ya loago, kwa ba neng ba kwalolola tshedimotsetso ya gago yotlhe teng.
Then we had to sign the consent form which informs you of the risks and it tells you that the vaccine that you are about to receive, the case we were about to receive and in this case we were getting the sinovac vaccine, which is developed here in China.	Morago ga moo re ne ra tshwanelwa ke go saena foromo ya tumelelo e e go itseseng ka dikotsi le go go bolelela ka moento o o tlileng go o amogela, ka nako eo re ne re amogela moento wa Sinovac, o o tlhamilweng mo China.
All of the vaccines that are being administered are being developed here in China.	Meento yotlhe e e tsamaisiwang e tlhamilwe gona mo China.
China is using two types of vaccines in its rollout programme  sinovac and sinopharm.	China e dirisa mefuta e mebedi ya meento e e dirisiwang mo lenaneong la go enta,  Sinovac le Sinopharm.
Both have been developed in China.	Bobedi jwa yona bo tlhamilwe kwa China.
Debates around the safety and efficacy of vaccines have not evaded Zanele, however, she says there is a different kind of anxiety involved when you face the jab.	Dingangisano ka pabalesego le tshireletsego ya meento ga di ise di lebalesege mo go Zanele, le fa go ntse jalo, a re go na le ketsaetsego e nngwe e o nnang le yona fa o lebagane le go tsaya moento.
I was a little bit anxious.	Ke ne ke tlhobaela go le gonnye.
I am not a fan of needles.	Ga ke motho yo o ratang dinalete.
I do brave it out, you know  when I have to.	Ke ne ke le pelokgale, waitse fa o tshwanetse go dira selo.
Ya, I didn’t even feel the injection going in.	Ee, ga ke a utlwa le fa nalete e tsena.
I looked away	Ke ile ka lebelela kwa thoko.
I didn’t even feel it because it was so small, it was quick.	Ga ke a e utlwa go nne e le nnye e bile e le ka bonako.
Not a lot of bleeding and I didnt feel any pain I must say when the doctor or when the health care worker administered the vaccine in my arm.	Ga ke a dutla madi a mantsi, ga ke a ikutlwa ke le mo botlhokong bope fa ngaka kgotsa modiri wa tlhokomelo ya boitekanelo a ne a tlhaba moento mo letsogong lame.
Zanele says observation is an important part of the process, and health care workers are on hand to monitor any possible side effects.	Zanele a re o lemogile gore kelotlhoko ke karolo e e botlhokwa ya tsamaiso mme badiri ba tlhokomelo ya boitekanelo ba dula ba le teng go baya ditlamorago tse di ka nnang teng leitlho.
After getting the shot, we had to go to an observation area across from where you get your shot.	Morago ga go entiwa, re ne ra tshwanelwa ke go ya kwa lefelong la kelotlhoko gaufi le kwa re entilweng gona.
You go and sit for about thirty minutes, where they are just observing you and monitoring whether you are having any adverse reactions to the vaccine or not.	O ya go nna metsotso e ka nna 30, kwa ba tla bong ba etse tlhoko gona gore moento o go tshwere sentle kgotsa nnyaa.
Most of the people there were just sitting.	Bontsi jwa batho koo bo ne bo ituletse fela.
There weren’t any reactions to the vaccine from my observation as I was sitting for that thirty minutes that I had to wait.	Ga go a nna le ditlamorago dipe tsa moento go ya ka moo ke boneng ka teng fa ke ne ke letile metsotso e le 30 e ke neng ke tshwaetse ke go e leta.
There were a lot of I guess volunteers, medical doctors around so we were being monitored I guess, properly.	Go ne go na le baithaopi ba le bantsi, dingaka tsa kalafi ka jalo re ne re tlhokometswe sentle, ka tshwanelo.
People were answering your questions when you had questions.	Batho ba ne ba araba dipotso tsa gago fa o ne o na le tsona.
Before leaving the massive vaccination camp, Zanele was given a strict set of protocols.	Pele ga go tsamaya kwa kampeng ya moento, Zanele o ne a newa melao e e gagametseng ya tlhokomelo.
They just said avoid alcohol, don’t consume any alcohol, which is easy for me because I don’t drink alcohol.	Ba rile efoga go nwa bojalwa, o seke wa nwa bojalwa bope, se se neng se le bonolo mo go nna gonne ga  ke nwe bojalwa.
Also, don’t eat spicy food and seafood.	Gape, ga ke je dijo tse di nang le pepere le dijo tsa lewatle.
Not to take a shower for the next 24hours.	Go se tlhape mo diureng di le 24 tse di latelang.
I just had to brave it out with the sweat and everything, because people were a little sweaty.	Ke ne ke tshwanetse go nna pelokgale, mofufutso le sengwe le sengwe, ka gonne batho ba a fufula.
China has made significant strides in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders.	China e dirile kgatelopele e e bonalang mo go lwantsheng leroborobo la COVID-19 mo melelwaneng ya yona.
By April 9th, only 14 cases were reported all of which from international travellers.	Ka di 9 tsa Moranang, ke dikgetse di le 14 fela tse di neng di begilwe tsotlhe tse go tswa go batsayaloeto ba kwa dinageng di sele.
Zanele says this success is attributed to both the governments swift and hard response, and the compliance of its citizenry.	Zanele re katlego e e fitlheletswe ke ke dipuso le go ikarabela ka thata, le kobamelo ya baagi.
We may have looked at those measures as being you know, cruel or very harsh.	Re ka tswa re ne le lebeletse dikgato tseo jaaka bosetlhogo le go tsholwa makgwakgwa thata.
But it shows that the intention was that to control the pandemic and make sure that it does not spread too far out of that particular area.	Mme se se bontsha gore maikaelelo e ne e le go laola leroborobo le go netefatsa gore ga le anamele kgakala le kwa ntle ga tikologo e e rileng.
Another thing that worked was the compliance that the Chinese people showed at that time.	Se sengwe se se se dirileng ke tirisanommogo e batho ba kwa China ba e bontshitseng ka nako eo.
They were willing to listen to what the government was saying and they stayed in their homes.	Ba ne ba ikemiseditse go reetsa se puso e se buang mme bad ula kwa magaeng a bona.

The presidency is monitoring the COVID-19 vaccination programme across the country.	Boporesidente bo tlhokomela lenaneo la moento wa COVID-19 go ralala naga.
Currently, the COVID-19 cases worldwide stand at over 134.5 million with more than 108.3 million recoveries and deaths at 2 915 013 million.	Ga jaanong jaana, dikgetse tsa COVD-19 mo lefatsheng lotlhe di eme go palo e e fetang dimilione di le 134.5 108.3, fa dipalo tsa pholo di feta dimilione di le 108.3 le dintsho di le dimilione di le 2 915 013.
In South Africa, the number of confirmed cases has surpassed the 1.5 million mark, whilst the death toll has risen to 53 173.	Mo Aforikaborwa, palo ya dikgetse tse di tlhomamisitsweng e fetile dimilione tse 1.5, fa palo ya dintsho e tlhatogetse go 53 173.
South Africa has the capacity and the scientific muscle to develop its own COVID-19 treatments.	Aforikaborwa e na le bokgoni jwa saense jwa go ka  tlhama kalafi ya yona ya COVID-19.
This emerged during a webinar on the role of scientific research in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.	Seno se tlhageletse ka webinara e ne e le ka ga karolo ya patlisiso ya saense mo go tlhofofatseng lerobororo la COVID-19 mo nageng ya rona.
The webinar was attended by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA).	Webinara e, e ne e tsenetswe ke ba Lefapha la Saense le Thekenoloji (DSI) le South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA).

I do think also that the country has seen this pandemic as an opportunity really, to have a very clear national strategic intent for us to build this capacity and that’s a key element.	Ke akanya gape gore naga ya rona e itemogetse leroborobo leno jaaka tšhono ya go nna le maikaelelo a togamaano ya bosetšhaba e e bonalang, go re kgontsha go aga bokgoni jo, mme ke yona karolo ya botlhokwa eo.
There’s clearly political will.	Go mo pepeneneng gore go na le maikaelelo a sepolotiki.
There is clearly support from the national government.	Go mo pepeneneng gore go na le tshegetso e e tswang kwa pusong.
There is clearly support from us as a regulator, she says.	Go mo pepeneneng gore go na le tshegetso go tswa mo go rona jaaka balaodi, a rialo.
The SAHPRA says it is currently reviewing Sputnik V, SinoVac, and other vaccines for approval for COVID-19.	SAHPRA ya re ga jaana e tshwaragane le go sekaseka Sputnik V, SinoVac, le meento e mengwe ya COVID-19 pele e ka rebolwa.
South Africa is currently vaccinating healthcare workers with the approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine.	Aforikaborwa ga jaanong jaana e enta badiri ba tlhokomelo ya boitekanelo ka moento wa Johnson & Johnson o o amogetsweng semmuso.
Over 200 000 people have been vaccinated so far.	Batho ba feta 200 000 ba setse entilwe go fitlha ga jaana.
Of the people who were vaccinated, about 17 have reported a COVID-19 positive test and that’s after about 14 days post-vaccination.	Go batho ba ba entilweng, ba le  17 fa diteko tsa bona COVID-19 di bontshitse fa ba tshwaetsegile, se ke morago ga malatsi a le 14 a go entiwa.
We haven’t done a full analysis yet.	Ga re ise se dire patlisiso e e feletseng.
We review results every week, we have passed the halfway mark.	Re sekaseka dipholo tsa beke nngwe le nngwe, re setse se fetile halofo ya maduo.
What we really want to show through this study is how does it work in a real-life setting in the field.	Se re tota re se batla ke go bontsha ka patlisiso e, ke gore e dira jang mo maemong a botshelo jo bo tlwaelegileng.
It prevents you from getting severe disease, almost an 85% protection against severe disease and then it offers 100% protection against death, says Goga.	E go thibela go bona bolwetse jo bo feteletseng, e go fa tshireletso ya 85% kgatlhanong le bolwetse jo bo tseneletseng mme e neelana ka 100% ya tshireletso kgatlhanong le loso, go bua Goga.
About 80% of people have reported the usual reactogenicity side effects that we would expect; fever, headaches, body aches, muscle aches, so these are flu-like symptoms.	80% ya batho ba begile ditlamorago tse di tlwaelegileng, tse re neng re di lebeletse; Letshoroma, go opiwa ke tlhogo, mmele o o botlhoko, mesifa e e botlhoko, ka jalo a ke matshwao a mokgotlhwane.

The South African Police Service (SAPS) has defended its officers saying they could have been on the scene of the alleged mob justice incident in Zandspruit, north of Johannesburg, earlier had the community not prevented them from getting there.	Tirelo ya Sepodisi sa Aforikaborwa (SAPS) e sireleditse batlhankedi ba yona ka gore ba ka bo ba ne ba ile kwa lefelong la tiragalo ya tekeko e e belaelwang kwa Zandspruit, Bokone jwa Johannesburg, fa setšhaba se ne se sa ba thibela go ya koo.
Earlier a community leader said the incident could have been averted had police responded swiftly.	Pelenyana, moeteledipele wa setšhaba o rile tiragalo e, e ka bo e sa diragala fa sepodisi se ne se fitlhile ka nako.
Community leader in Zandspruit in Gauteng describes as shocking, alleged mob justice incident which left 4 men dead and 5 others critically injured.	Moeteledipele wa baagi kwa Zandspruit kwa Gauteng, o tlhalositse e le tiragalo e e tshosang ya go batla bosiamisi e e tlogetseng banna  ba le 4 ba tlhokafetse le ba bangwe ba le 5 ba gobetse.
Themba Mchunu says police could have done more to avert death of the men who were beaten to death and set alight by some residents.	Themba Mchunu a re sepodisi se ka bo se dirile go le gontsi go tila loso lwa banna ba ba iteilweng go fitlhelela ba tlhokafala le go fisiwa ga baagi ba bangwe.
The incident left four men dead and five others critically injured in the informal settlement on Wednesday.	Tiragalo e e tlogetse banna ba le bane ba tlhokafetse le ba le batlhano ba gobetse thata kwa mafelong a baipei ka Laboraro.
This after, angry residents took nine young men to a local sports ground and beat them up after accusing them of terrorising the community.	Se ke morago ga gore baagi ba ba neng ba šhakgetse ba tseye banna ba bašwa ba le robonngwe b aba ise kwa lebaleng la metshameko ya selegae mme ba ba itaya morago ga go ba latofatsa ka go sotla setšhaba.
The residents also set the men alight.	Baagi ba ile ba fisa banna ba ka molelo.
It’s alleged that about 200 people from the Zandspruit informal settlement attacked a group of 9 boys that they had suspected of robbing people in the area,	Batho ba ka nna 200 go tswa kwa lefelong la baipei kwa Zandspruit ba latofaditswe ka go tlhasela setlhopha sa basimane ba le 9 ba ba neng ba belaelwa ka go kgothosa batho mo lefelong.
Police spokesperson, Kay Makhubele says there is no excuse.	Mmueledi wa sepodisi, Kay Makhubele a re ga go na lebaka.
The sector vehicle indeed went to the scene after they called and about 200 people stoned the vehicle and it made a U-turn and called a backup thats when people disperse from the ground.	Koloi ya Setheo e ile kwa lefelong la tiragalo morago ga go bidiwa mme batho ba ba ka nnang 200 ba ne ba tlhasela sejanaga seo ka matlapa mme se ile sa boela morago go ya go batla thuso, ke moo batho ba ileng ba phatlalala gona.
If the police are not responding we have got a protocol to follow, if they are not getting help from the police they must go to the station commander and talk to him or the district commander.	Fa sepodisi se sa arabe go na le tsamaiso e e tshwanetseng go latelwa, fa ba sa bone thuso go tswa go sepodisi ba tshwanetse go etela Molaodi wa seteišene go bua le ene kgotsa Molaodi wa kgaolo.
So they cannot give excuses of killing people because police are not responding.	Ka jalo ga ba kake ba dira maipato a gore ba bolaile batho gonne sepodisi se ne se sa ba tlhage thuso.
Professor Goga says, in South Africa, people have implemented behavioural changes for the betterment of their future health.	Moporofesara Goga a re mo Aforikaborwa, batho ba setse ba tsentse tirisong diphetogo tsa boitsholo go tokafatsa boitekanelo jwa bona mo isagweng.
It has taken a pandemic to teach us that health is not just the absence of disease.	Go tsere leroborobo go re ruta gore boitekanelo ga se fela go tlhokega ga bolwetse.
It is a state of social, physical and social well-being.	Ke maemo a go itekanela ga loago le mo mmeleng.
It has taken a pandemic to show us that health is inter-connected.	Go tsere leroborobo gore bontsha gore boitekanelo bo kopanetswe.
No one is healthy until everybody is healthy.	Ga go na motho yo o tla itekanelang ba bangwe ba sa itekanela.
Health for all is something we really need to strive for.	Boitekanelo jwa botlhe ke se re tshwanetseng go se lwela.
We have not attained it yet.	Ga re ise re bo fitlhelele.
The country has also recorded 37 new COVID-19-related fatalities on Tuesday.	Naga e rekotile dintsho tse dintšhwa tse 37 tse di amanang le COVID-19 ka Labobedi.
This brings the total number of deaths to 53 032.	Se se isa palogotlhe ya dintsho go 53 032.

The league was quick to point on that the postponement was not an admission that Royal AM was correct in their interpretation of the Nyathi ruling.	Liki e nnile bonako go tlhagisa gore go busediwa morago e ne e se kamogelo ya gore Royal AM e ne e nepagetseng mo tlhalosong ya bona ya katlholo ya ga Nyathi.
The leagues legal representatives have now responded to the Royal AM, stating that there seems to be a dispute regarding the order by Judge Nyathi on Monday.

The league has stated that it intends to apply to the High Court on an urgent basis for a declaratory order on the Judge Nyathi order and its suspension.	Liki e tlhalositse gore e ikaelela go dira kopo kwa kgotlatshekelong e e potlakileng gore go ntshiwe taelo ya motheo ya ga Moatlhodi Nyathi le kgapelothoko ya yona.

On Saturday, judgment was handed in the much-anticipated Glad  Africa Championship promotion case involving Sekhukhune United, Polokwane City and Royal AM, at the Johannesburg High Court.	Ka Lamatlhatso, katlholo e ne ya neelwa mo kgaisanong ya Glad Africa e e akaretsang Sekhukhune United, Polokwane City le Royal AM, kwa kgotlatshekelo e e kwa godimo kwa Johannesburg.
The counterclaim to review the arbitration award given by Epstein SC on 19 May 2021 is dismissed, read in part the High Court order.	Topotuelo ya go sekaseka tsereganyo e e neetsweng ke Epstein SC ka di 19 Motsheganong 2021 ga e a amogelwa, buisa go ya ka karolo ya taelo ya kgotlatshekelo e e kwa godimo.
Following that match, which they lost 1-0,Ba Bina Noko, as Sekhukhune United are affectionately known,lodged a complaint with the PSL DC, complaining that City had failed to include five Under-23 players on their team sheet, as per the PSL rules.	Ga latela motshameko o mo go ona ba tlhotsweng 1- 0, Ba Bina Noko, jaaka Sekhukhune United e itsege, ba tsentse ngongorego mo PSL DC, ba ngongoregela gore City e paletswe ke go akaretsa batshameki ba dingwaga tse di kwa tlase ga 23 ba le tlhano mo setlhopheng sa bona go ya ka melawana ya PSL.
While the PSL DC found Polokwane City guilty and deducted the three points they had irregularly secured against Sekhukhune, they decided not to award those point to the opposing team, as it had done so in similar previous cases.	Fa PSL DC e sena go bona Polokwane City molato le go gogela morago dintlha di le tharo tse ba neng ba di fitlhetse kgatlhanong le Sekhukhune, ba tsere tshwetso ya go se abele setlhopha se se ganetsang dintlha tseo, jaaka ba ne ba dirile mo mabakeng a a tshwanang a mo nakong e e fetileng.
This prompted Ba Bina Noko to lodge an appeal against the PSL DCs decision, the results of which was a decision by arbitration toward the three points and three goals to United, a few days before the final round of matches which would decide which team between Royal AM and United would gain straight promotion to the DSTV Premiership.	Se se dirile gore Ba Bina Noko ba tlhatlhele kgetse kgatlhanong le tshwetso ya PSL DC. Dipholo tse e neng e le tshwetso e e dirilweng ke botsereganyi kgatlhanong le dintlha di le tharo le dino di le tharo go United malatsi a le mmalwa pele ga karolo ya bofelo ya metshameko e e tla swetsang gore ke setlhopha sefe magareng ga Royal AM le United se se tla amogelang tlhatloso go ya kwa metshamekong ya DSTV.
However, the PSL Executive Committee, subsequently, challenged the decision by arbitration, refusing to award the points and the goals to Sekhukhune United.	Le fa go ntse jalo, Komiti khuduthamaga ya PSL, morago ga moo, e ne ya botsolotsa tshwetso ya katlholo, ya go gana go abela Sekhukhune United dintlha le dino.
The decision was to the benefit of Royal AM who went into their final match against Cape Town All-Stars at the top of the first division log.	Tshwetso e, e ne e tshwanetse go tswela Royal AM, e e tseneng mo motshamekong wa makgaola kgang kgatlhanong le Cape Town All-Stars mosola kwa godimo ga kgaolo ya ntlha.
They went on to win their final match after being awarded a much-talked-about soft penalty in the final stage of their decisive match even though the PSL didn’t hand the trophy and medal citing that they had been served with court papers.	Ba ne ba tswelela go fenya motshameko wa bona wa bofelo morago ga go newa penalethi e e boleta mo kgatong ya bofelo ya motshameko wa bona le mororo PSL e sa ba neela sekgele le mmentlele mme ba kaya fa se e le ka ntlha ya fa ba ne ba neetswe dipampiri tse di tswang kwa kgotlatshekelo.

We’re mixing it with Europe’s best teams.	Re e kopakopanya le ditlhopha tse di gaisang tsa kwa Europe.
Angelovski remained tight-lipped about possible changes to the starting line-up and formation.	Angelovski ga a a bua sepe ka ga diphetogo tse di ka diragalang kwa tshimolong le mo popegong ya setlhopha.
A thin bench does not give him too many options, although Ivan Trickovski could be preferred to Aleksandar Trajkovski up front.	Banka e e tshesane ga e mo fe ditshono di le dintsi thata, le mororo Ivan Trickovski e le ena a batliwang go gaisa Aleksandar Trajkovski kwa pele.
Defender Stefan Ristovski said team spirit was still high.	Mosireletsi Stefan Ristovski o rile mowa wa setlhopha o ne o santse o le kwa godimo.
We can’t let one defeat sink our mood and being in the Euros for the first time.	Re ka se letle go fenngwa gangwe fela go senye maikutlo a rona le go nna mo Euros lwa ntlha.
There isn’t much time for misery or celebrations whatever happens, he said.	Ga go na nako e ntsi ya kutlobotlhoko kgotsa ya keteko, le fa go ka diragala eng. a rialo.

Ukraine not need extra motivation heading into Thursdays Euro 2020 Group C game with North Macedonia and are feeling positive despite narrowly losing their opening match against the Netherlands, head coach Andriy Shevchenko said on Wednesday.	Ukraine ga e kitla e tlhoka tlhotlheletso e e kwa godimo fa ba tsena mo motshamekong wa Euro 2020, setlhopha C le North Macedonia ka Labone, mme ba ikutlwa ba na le maikutlo a a siameng le fa ba ne ba latlhegetswe mo motshakong wa bona wa pulo kgatlhanong le go Netherlands, tlhogo ya bakatisi Andriy Shevchenko o buile jalo ka Laboraro.
Ukraine came back from 2-0 down against the Dutch on Sunday and looked set to earn a draw but a late goal by Denzel Dumfries left them empty-handed.	Ukraine e ikarabetse ka 2-0 go Dutch ka Sontaga mme ba ne ba lebega ba le malala a laotswe go iponela maleka, fela nno ya ga Denzel Dumfries e ba siile ba iphotlhere.
We have complete understanding within the team.	Re tlhaloganya setlhopha ka botlala.
We know the tasks we have ahead of us and additional words aren’t necessary.	Re a itse gore ke ditiro dife tse di re emetseng mme ga go botlhokwa gore re bue go feta foo.
The team is getting ready mentally, Shevchenko told reporters.	Batshameki ba setlhopha ba baakanya ditlhaloganyo tsa bona, Shevchenko o boleletse babegakgang.
This is a really important tournament.	Se ke thonamente e e botlhokwa thata.
Its not every year that we get to the group stage of the European Championship, so every player understands the importance of each match and has responsibility for their own game and the game of the team.	Ga e se ngwaga le ngwaga mo re fitlhang kwa maemong a setlhopha mo metshamekong ya makgaolakgang ya kwa Europe, ka jalo motshameki mongwe le mongwe o tlhaloganya botlhokwa jwa motshameko mongwe le mongwe mme o na le maikarabelo a motshameko  wa gagwe le motshameko wa setlhopha ka kakaretso.
So we don’t need any additional words.	Ka jalo ga re tlhoke mafoko go tlaleletsa.
North Macedonia were beaten 3-1 by Austria in their first match and sit bottom of the group standings below Ukraine.	North Macedonia e fentswe 3-1 ke Austria mo motshamekong wa bona wa ntlha mme ba dutse mo maemong a a kwa tlase ga Ukraine.
Shevchenko said the atmosphere in his team was good and they would not underestimate their opponents, who are playing their first major tournament as an independent nation.	Shevchenko o rile maikutlo mo setlhopheng sa gagwe a ne a le mantle mme ga ba kitla ba nyatsa ditlhopha tse di tlaa tshamekang kgatlhanong le ba bona, tse di tshamekang thonamente ya tsona ya ntlha jaaka naga e e ikemetseng.
We know we lacked just a little bit to achieve a positive result.	Re itse gore re tlhaetse go le gonnye fela gore re kgone fitlhelela dipholo tse di itumedisang.
The reaction from the team was great.	Tsibogo go tswa go setlhopha e ne e itumedisa.
We had many good moments and we are very positive about the game ahead, Shevchenko said.	Re nnile le nako e e itumedisang mme re na le tsholofelo mo motshamekong o o tlang, Shevchenko o buile jalo.
North Macedonia are a team that deserve respect.	North Macedonia ke setlhopha se se tshwanelwang ke tlotlo.
They have character, their own style of play and they counter-attack well.	Ba na le botho, mokgwa wa bona wa go tshameka mme ba tlhasela sentle.
During the last couple of years, they have had several good games where they have beaten top teams.	Mo dingwageng di le dintsi tse di fetileng, ba nnile le metshameko e e siameng, e mo go yona ba fentseng ditlhopha tse di kwa godimo.
So we have to be really careful of their counter-attacks.	Ka jalo re tshwanetse go nna kelotlhoko thata ka tlhaselo ya bona.
Turkey coach Senol Gunes blamed their poor start to Euro 2020 on a flurry of individual mistakes after a 2-0 defeat to Wales on Wednesday left them without a point after two games.	Mokatisi wa Turkey Senol Gunes o supile batshameki ba ba rileng ka monwana ka ntlha ya diphoso tse ba di dirileng kwa tshimologong ya Euro 2020, morago ga gore phenyo ya Wales ya 2-0 ka Laboraro e ba sie ba sena ntlha morago ga metshameko e mebedi.
After losing 3-0 to Italy in their opening Group A game, Turkey fell to their second consecutive defeat after Aaron Ramsey and Connor Roberts scored for Wales at Bakus Olympic Stadium.	Morago ga go latlhegelwa 3-0 go Italy mo motshamekong wa setlhopha sa A, Turkey e wetse tlase morago ga gore Aaron Ramsey le Connor Roberts ba nosetse Wales kwa lebaleng la metshameko la Bakus.
I don’t think we ever got over the shock of the first game (against Italy), said Gunes.	Ga ke akanye gore re amogetseng letshogo le re nnileng le lona ka motshameko wa ntlha (kgatlhanong le Italy), Gunes a rialo.
Especially for the first half an hour, I think we were stuck in the previous game.	Segolo bogolo ka halofo ya ura ya ntlha, ke akanya gore re ne re santse re akantse motshameko o fetileng.
Despite that, we made a good start to the second half and dominated for a while, until we started making individual mistakes again, the veteran coach said.	Le fa go le jalo, re dirile tshimologo e e siameng mo halofong ya bobedi mme motshameko o ne wa laolwa ke rona nakwana, go fitlha re simolola go dira diphoso gape, mokatisi yo o nang le maitemogelo o buile jalo.
Turkey, who face Switzerland in their final group match on Sunday, have conceded five goals in their first two games of the tournament and scored none.	Turkey, e e tla lebaganang le  Switzerland mo motshamekong wa bona wa bofelo wa setlhopha,ba lekile go nosa dino di le tlhano mo metshamekong ya bona e mebedi ya ntlha ya thonamente mme ba feleleditse ba sa nosa le fa e nngwe ya dino tseo.
I don’t remember us making so many errors in passing, ever.	Ga ke gakologelwe re dira diphoso tse dintsi jaana mo go fetiseng kgwele, le eseng.
When you lose the ball so easily, and have such a difficulty in getting it back, no wonder you’ll struggle, Gunes added.	Fa o latlhegelwa ke kgwele bonolo jalo, mme o na le bothata jwa go e busetsa gape kwa go wena, ga go gakgamatse gore o tlaa nna le bothata. Gunes a tlaleletsa.
Asked whether his tactics played a role in the two losses, Gunes said: You can add the inexperience to the mix, the lack of physical power, and the will to fight one on one with each player.	Fa a bodiwa gore a maano a gagwe a nnile le seabe mo ditatlhegelong tse pedi  tse, Gunes o rile: “O ka tsenya go tlhoka maitemogelo mo kgannyeng e, tlhaelo ya maatla a mmele, le kitso ya go lwantsha batshameki ka bongwe ka bongwe”.
At the end of the day, I am observing a weight on the shoulders of the team and we failed to boost their confidence to take it off of them.	Kwa bokhutlong jwa letsatsi, ke etse tlhoko morwalo o o relweng ke setlhopha mo magetleng a bona, mme re paletswe ke go tiisa nonofo ya bona ka boikanyego gore re kgone go ba rola morwalo o.
I take full responsibility.	Ke tsaya maikarabelo ka botlalo.
They are all good players, but we expected more from them.	Botlhe ke batshameki ba ba siameng, mme re ne re solofetse go le gontsi go tswa mo go bona.
It’s not right to blame the players.	Ga go siama gore re tshwaye batshemeki diphoso.
Italy lead Group A with six points after two rounds of matches and are ahead of Wales(four), Switzerland(one)and Turkey(zero).	Italy e eteletse pele Setlhopha sa A ka dintlha di le thataro morago ga metshameko e mebedi mme ba eteletse kwa pele Wales (nne), Switzerland (nngwe) le Turkey (lefela).
They can seal top spot with a draw in their final pool game against Wales on Sunday.	Ba ka iponela maemo a a kwa godimo go feta ka go tshameka maleka mo motshamekong wa bona wa bofelo kgatlhanong le Wales ka Sontaga.
Italy become the first team to reach the Round of 16.	Italy ke yona setlhopha sa ntlha go fitlhelela kwa karolong ya 16.
Wales scored right at the death in injury time when a corner was played short and Connor Roberts was on hand to divert a Bale pass past goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir to seal the victory.	Wales e nositse ka nako ya dikgobalo fa go ne go tshamekiwa huku mme Connor Robert o ne a le malala a laotswe go faposa kgwele e o gore e fete motshwaradino e leng Ugurcan Cakir go bona phenyo.
Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic has told his players not to show in-form Italy too much respect and have belief that they can win when the teams meet in a European Championship Group A clash in Rome on Wednesday.	Mokatisi wa Switzerland Vladimir Petkovic o boleletse batshameki ba gagwe gore ba se ka ba bontsha Italy tlotla e e feteletseng mme ba nne le tumelo ya gore ba ka kgona go fenya fa ditlhopha tse di kopana mo thulanong ya dikgaisano tsa makgaolakgang tsa kwa Europe kwa Rome ka Laboraro.
Italy brushed aside Turkey 3-0 in their tournament opener with a slick display that continued their fine form of going unbeaten in their last 28 games dating back to September 2018.	Italy e kgapetse kwa thoko Turkey 3-0 mo kgaisanong ya ga go bula mo metshamekong ya bona ya bofelo e le 28 go tloga ka Lwetse 2018.
We will do what we have always done, which is to play our own game, Petkovic told reporters on Tuesday.	Re tla dira se re tlwaetseng go se dira, e leng go tshameka motshameko wa rona, Petkovic o boleletse babegadikgang ka Labobedi.
We will respect Italy, but not too much.	Re tla tlotla Italy, fela e seng go feta selekanyo.
They are the big favourites, not only in our group, but in general in this tournament.	Ke bommamoratwa ba bagolo, e seng fela mo setlhopheng sa rona, mme mo kgaisanong eno ka kakaretso.
We all saw the quality they showed against Turkey.	Rotlhe re bone boleng jo ba bo bontshitse kgatlhanong le Turkey.
But we have quality too and can surprise them.	Mme le rona le na le boleng e bile re ka ba gakgamatsa.
We will try to turn the game in our favour and be a bit quicker when we attack and create chances.	Re tla leka go fetola motshameko gore o direle rona mme re nne bonako go tlhasela le go tlhama tšhono.
Switzerland have matched Belgium, Brazil, England and Spain in recent years, which Petkovic says should give them cause for optimism.	Switzerland e tshamekile kgatlhanong le Belgium, Brazil, England le Spain mo dingwageng tse di fetileng, se Petkovic a reng se tshwanetse go ba naya lebaka le le isegang.
I hope that we will give 120%, just like we did against all the other big teams.	Ke solofela gore re tla bontsha 120%, fela jaaka re dirile kgatlhanong le ditlhopha tse dingwe tse dikgolo.
We will need to be better than we actually are.	Re tla tlhoka go nna botoka go feta ka mokgwa o re leng ka teng.
We will have to have a great effort, run a lot and be great in duels.	Re tla tshwanelwa ke go nna le maikaelelo a magolo, re taboge thata mme re nne batshameki ba ba siameng.
Then we can win, he said.	Ka jalo re ka fenya, o ne a bolela jalo.
We need to play our own game and be dangerous in the final third.	Re tlhoka go tshameka motshameko wa rona le go nna kotsi mo karolong ya bofelo ya boraro.
We must guard against certain Italian moves, but also be true to ourselves.	Re tshwanetse go ela tlhoko maItaly  a a rileng, mme gape re nne le nnete mo go rona.
Let’s take things one match at a time, we will not get ahead of ourselves, he added.	Tla re tseye dilo ka bongwe ka bongwe ka nako, ga re kitla re iketelela kwa pele, a tlaleletsa.
It is very important to give 120% with the best starting XI available.	Go botlhokwa thata go naya 120%, ka tshimologo e e ntle ya XI e e leng teng.
We hope we can produce a big performance and win the match to be sure that we can go through to the next round.	Re solofela gore re tla tlhagisa tiragalo e kgolo le go fenya kgaisano e go netefatsa gore re ka kgona go ya kwa legatong le le latelang.
Italy coach Roberto Mancini said his excellent team can only improve ahead of their second European Championship match, against Switzerland, even though they made a near perfect start in their opening clash with Turkey last week.	Mokatisi wa Italy Roberto Mancini a re setlhopha sa gagwe se tlaa  tokafala fela pele ga motshameko wa kgaisano wa bobedi kgatlhanong le Switzerland, le fa ba dirile tshimologo e e batlileng e le botoka thata mo thulanong ya bona ya pulo le Turkey mo bekeng e e fetileng.
The Turkey game was difficult, Mancini told a news conference.	Motshameko wa Turkey o ne o le boima thata, Mancini o boleletse khonferense ya dikgang.
But when we scored, they opened up.	Mme e rile fa sena go nosa, ba lokologa.
We will have to win the next one and if possible also the next one.	Re tla tshwanelwa ke go fenya e e latelang mme fa go kgonega, re fenye e nngwe gape e e latelang.
We have to do our best.	Re tshwanetse go dira bojotlhe jwa rona.
I am confident.	Ke na le tsholofelo.
This is an excellent team that can only improve.	Se, ke setlhopha se se gaisang se se ka tokafalang..
If the English bookmakers say (Italy are favourites), we accept it because they get it right, but the championship is still long.	Fa batsayadibetšhe ba maasemane ba ka re (Italy ke yona mmamoratwa), re a amogela ka gore ba dira sentle, mme fela mo kgaisano e sa ntse e le telele.
We have much work to do.	Re na le tiro e ntsi e re tshwanetseng go e dira.
Victory over Switzerland will see Italy become the first team to reach the knockout stages of Euro 2020, with one Group A match still to play.	Phenyo ya Switzerland e tlaa dira gore Italy e nne yona setlhopha sa ntlha go fitlhelela dikgato tsa peletsontle tsa EURO 2020, ka motshameko o le mongwe wa setlhopha sa A o santse o tlile go tshameka.
However, the Italians have won their opening two matches only twice in their nine previous appearances at the European Championship, doing so in 2000 and 2016, and Mancini is not taking Switzerland lightly.

He said Wales had shown a defensive approach, which the Turkish squad had analysed.	O rile Wales e bontshitse mokgwa wa phemelo, o o sekasekilweng ke setlhopha sa kwa Turkey.
For tomorrow’s game we are not thinking about if it will be three or four players (in defence).	Mo motshamekong wa kamoso ga re akanye gore a e ka nna batshameki ba le bararo kgotsa ba le bane (go sireletsa).
I prefer they’d play without a defence, Yilmaz joked.	Ke eletsa ekete ba ka tshameka kwa ntle ga tshireletso, Yilmaz a dira motlae.

Letlhakore la ga Fernando Santos la Portugal ke lona le le tiileng mo selekanyong sa dingwaga di le tlhano, le humile ka batlhasedi ba ba tshwanang le Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, Joao Felix le Fernandes gammogo le Ronaldo yo o dulang a ikemiseditse.
This is a different group, we have many young players embarking on their first major international tournament although our ambition and hunger will be the same as in Euro 2016, added 29-year-old Danilo.

The previous team was very cohesive as they had been playing together for a long time while we are a young team of emerging talents but we are also a united group.	Setlhopha se se fetileng se ne se lomaganeng ka ba ne ba ntse ba tshameka mmogo mo nakong e telele.

We all think the same and want to win.	Rotlhe re akanya ka go tshwana mme go batla go fenya.
Hungary, meanwhile, are a less potent side than the one which reached the knockout stage last time around, with big personalities such as Gabor Kiraly, Roland Juhasz and Zoltan Gera all moving on.

Naming one player would be a disservice to the others.	Fa ke ntsha leina le le lengwe fela ke tla be ke sa direle ba bangwe sentle.
They have huge potential in all areas of the pitch.	Ba na le bokgoni jo bontsi mo dikarolong tsotlhe tsa lebala..
We need to help one another out, we need to make sure were very compact, and close down the space between the lines.	Re tlhoka go thusana, re tshwanetse go netefatsa gore re mmogo, mme re tswale diphatlha fa gare ga mela.
Hungary rely on a robust defence and counter-attacks.	Hungary e ikaegile thata mo tshireletsong e e popota le tlhaselo.
Fewer big names in their squad means the team may be fresher than opponents who have played full seasons in big domestic and international tournaments.	Maina a le mantsi a a sa tlwaelegang mo setlhopheng a kaya gore setlhopha se tla be se le matlhagatlhaga go feta se ba tshamekang kgatlhanong le sona, se se tshamekileng mo dithonamenteng tsa selegae le tsa boditšhabatšhaba.
Bundesliga stalwarts like Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi do play for Hungary, tough opponents even without their most valuable player, Dominik Szoboszlai.	Bagaka ba Bundesliga ba ba tshwanang le motshwaradino wa Leipzig e leng Peter Gulacsi ba tshamekela Hungary, ke batshameki ba ba popota le kwa ntle ga motshameki wa bona yo o tlhwatlhwa, Dominik Szoboszlai.

Hungary and Portugal played one of the most exciting group matches at Euro 2016, with Hungary leading three times and Portugal equalising on each occasion including two goals by Cristiano Ronaldo.

Hungary finished top of the group before losing 4-0 to Belgium in the round of 16 while Portugal won the title.	Hungary e ne e itlhomile kwa pele mo setlhopheng pele ga go latlhegelwa ka 4-0 kgatlhanong le Belgium mo karolong ya 16 fa Portugal yona e ikgapetse sekgele.
Eight teams will qualify for the following season’s Champions Cup.	Ditlhopha di le robedi di tlaa tsenela dikgaisano tsa sekgele mo setlheng se se latelang.
