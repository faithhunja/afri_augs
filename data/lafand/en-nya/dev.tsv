A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist.

Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported. Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.

Zimbabwe police Saturday blocked the country's main opposition party from holding rallies ahead of March 26 elections to fill seats that have fallen vacant since the general election in 2018.

Chamisa said his party does not want to fight with people. He said the government denied permission to hold a rally, so the party asked for permission to come and tell about that. He told his supporters he does not want the politics of Zimbabwe to cause any death. Then he added that what the government does not know is that here in Marondera, his arrival is good enough.

The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying civil servants in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar.

The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit. 	Kupezeka kwa Mercenaries kwakula  koposaposa kwambiri kuyambira mu 2019 mu mkumano wa Russia-Africa.
"Moscow has been active ""especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence"" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university.

"While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue ""really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources,"" Doxsee said.

"	"Anthu aku Nigeria sakhala ndichidwi akabwera ku tchalitchi, Aanatero Abunulo. ""Amakonda kuimba, amakonda kuvina. Mapemphero atha kutha maora awiri. Iwo sadandaura za zimenezo."""
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church. As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies. 	Pamene anali ndi zaka 18 ku U.S , Abunulo wakalapo pamaudindo oyang'anira zamapemphero komanso kugwira nchito za Ubusa mdziko monse.

Zigawo za U.S komanso mabugwe a katolika anasitha kukhala olemba athu dziko lonse polemba anthu omwe amafuna.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica. Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served. 	Zigawo za Birminham, komwe Abunulo amatsogolera mipingo iwiri, Wakulitsa kayang'ana malo okhazikitsa mpingo ndikuchulukitsa malo ogwilira ntchito achipepembedzo ngati Nigeria ndi Cameroon, anatero Abishop Steven Raica aku Birminham.

"Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region. There, the seminaries are ""fairly full,"" said the Rev. Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church. "	Ku Africa ndi chigawo chimene tchaitchi cha chi katolika  chakula mwachangu kwambiri. Kumene malo aansembe ndiodzadza, anatero Rev Thomas Gaunnt, Wankulu otsogolera  Sukulu yaukachenjede ya Centre for Applied  Research in the Apostolate,  imene imapanga kafukufuku wa mpingo wa katolika.
Falling numbers 	Kutsika kwa ma nambala.
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals. 	Ndizosiyana ndiku U.S kumene mpingo  wa katolika wakumana ndimavuto pakulemba anthu omwe akulira mu mpingo mommo kutsalira  kutsika kwa kabweledwe ka anthu ku mpingo kwa zaka teni zapitazi komanso kuonongeka kwa mbiri yomwe inafala ya nchititdwe ogonana wa pa mpingo.

"""What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country,"" Gaunt said. ""Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality."" "	Zomwe tilinazo pano ndi nambala yochipa kwambiri  kuyambira 1970 kulowa umsembe komanso usisiteri mudziko, Gaunt anatero.

From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center. This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor. 	Kuchokera  1970 kufika 2020 ma numbera a amsembe ku U.S anatsika ndi 60%, kuengera mu kaundura yemwe anachokera ku GeorgetownCenter.

Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama. His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line. After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish. 	Abunulo amayang'anira mipingo iwiri ku mudzi wa Alabama.

"""He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories,"" said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988. "	Anangoyamba kuimba nyimbo ndipo aphunzitsi ake ambiri,  anaphatikizira chinayamata chake, ndipo ndinali okondwa kumva nkhani zimenezi, anatero  Amber Moosman, Mphunzitsi wa mulingo oyambilira  amene anali opemphera opuma pa mpingo wa  Holy Family kuyambira mchaka cha 1988.
"For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. ""There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that. … It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict,"" she said. ""It's a lot different now.""

Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate pastor in the diocese of Oakland, California, where his ministry focused on the fast-growing Nigerian Catholic community. Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.

"When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, ""Where is West Virginia?""

She was scared, worrying about the unknowns. 	Iye amkaopa, kudandaura pazinthu zosadziwika
"""What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country,"" Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004.

"Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and ""rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank. … She thought I was dirty."" Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming. She's now a U.S. citizen and says, ""It feels like home."" "	"Rukwishuro akukumbukira bwino lomwe kuti pakuonetseredwa koyamba, ka mtsikana kanalowa namusisita zala zanga ndi zala zake Njira yonse, kenako anayang'ana zala zake  ndipo anamwetulira koma ndi mtima wanga unakhala pansi, … Amkaona ngati ndine osasamalika ndi nyasi, "" kupatura zimenezo Rukwishuro anati anthu ambiri akhara akumulandira iye bwino kwambiri.

Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve. To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations. 	Onyewuche anati Mipingo yaku Africa itha kukumana ndimavuto  olumikizana ndi  mbadwa zaku Ameriza zomwe zikutumikira. Pokonza chimenechi zigawo zambiri zapatsidwa maphuziro okonza kayankhulidwe.

Chinese loan concerns 	Madando okhudzana ndi ngongole zopelekedwa ndi anthu a ku China
"China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. It is trying to ""equal the U.S."" as a donor country, he said. "	"Dziko la China limalimbikitsa kubwereketsa ndalama ku mayiko a mu Africa pofuna zopindulitsa zambili pa zobzyala komanso mbili ya bwino pa dziko lonse lapansi yothandiza mayiko osauka., anatero Edward Miguel,mphunzitsi wa Environmental Resources Economics pa university ya Califonia ku Berkeley.

However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes.

"Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as ""no strings attached,"" which has been attractive for many countries.  But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. "	"Kupatula ngongole zochokera kwa azungu, kapena mabungwe obwereketsa apadziko lonse lapansi  monga World Bank , zomwe zimafunika ntchito komanso kuteteza za chilengedwe  pa ntchito zopatsilidwa ndalama, chithandizo cha China ndi ngongole zopita ku Africa zinafotokozedwa ngati ""zilibe cholowa kwa opeleka,"" zomwe zinakopa mayiko ambili.Koma mayiko a ku Africa makamaka omwe chuma chawo n'chovutika chifukwa cha COVID 19, amakumana ndi zovuta kubweza ngongole, anatero Hannah Ryder,Senior associate wa African Program at U.S think tank for strategic and international studies"

Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted.

Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington.

Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change 	Owona zanyengo ku zimbabwe akufana zithu zapamwamba kwambiri zokhudza kusintha kwa nyengo.
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change. Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out.

Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere. 	Lachiwiri ku Scotland, Mtsogoleli Emmerso Mnangagwa anayankhura pa nsonkhano wa maiko  wazakusintha kwa nyengo wa 2021,kudziwika ngati COP26, komwe anapepmpha maiko olemera kuti alipile chifukwa chowononga mpweya wamulengalenga pakuchotsa mpweya  mulengalenga.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions. 	Anati maiko ovutika ngati Zimbabwe  amalipira pazotsatirazi zakuonongeka kwa mpweyako.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change. 	Anapemphanso dziko lake kuti agwilizane polimbana nikusintha kwa nyengo.
"""Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030.

"""But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy. In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster.

"""Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems.

"""So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe. The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming. What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation. We may also need to promote intensive farming methods as opposed to extensive farming methods that require bigger fields and the clearing of new forests for fields,"" Zamasiya said.

Mnangagwa also said he was happy about a report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Alena Douhan after a two-week visit to Zimbabwe.

Koma mau otepedwa omwe anatulutsidwa  ku nyumba youanganira mbadzwa zaku U.S ku Harare, Kazembe wa U.S ku United Nation Linda Thomas Greenfield anati chilango cha atsogoleri aku Zimbabwe   sichimapweteka  mbadwa zawamba.
"""Our sanctions target individuals and institutions that are committing human rights violations. And we make every effort to ensure those sanctions do not impact the people. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a result of bad policies in Zimbabwe. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a consequence of their leadership. It is not a consequence of our sanctions, and we will always resist any criticism that says our sanctions are impacting people unfairly. We are criticized by the government [of Zimbabwe] for these actions because they know they are responsible for these actions. I regret that the special rapporteur decided to put this in [her] report,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

The European Union imposed travel and financial sanctions on then-Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and his allies in 2002, in response to reports of election-rigging and human rights.

"""Various initiatives have been implemented to improve the dignity, welfare and economic empowerment of veterans of the liberation struggle and dependence of the heroes,"" Mnangagwa said. ""But I urge the war veterans to use procedures in the party, not outside the party.Their rich ideological grounding should galvanize the principle of patriotism in the hearts and minds of cadres and embolden them in their efforts to ensure that ZANU-PF remains the party of choice which wholeheartedly serves the people.""

Zimbabwe Government: No COVID-19 Shot, No Work, No Pay  	Boma la Zimbabwe: Osabayitsa katemera wa Covid, osagwira ntchito, osalandira ndalama
Union leaders have angrily reacted to the Zimbabwean governments announcement Sunday that workers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer be allowed at work and will not be paid.

"""Fundamentally, there was no agreement over the issue of vaccination,"" said Takavafira Zhou, president of Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe. ""Our position as workers has always remained that we encourage our members to be vaccinated. But by no means should our encouragement be misconstrued for mandatory vaccination. Our position is very clear: vaccination must be voluntary. Not mandatory.

""[C]ricket lovers in Pakistan and around the world will be disappointed by this last-minute withdrawal,"" the board said.

""Ministry of Interior has informed me that the English team is also thinking along the same lines. On our part, we are ready to welcome them.

International cricket teams stopped visiting Pakistan after an attack on a Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009 in Lahore that wounded seven members of the team.   Pakistan went through several years of violence starting approximately in 2007 as extremist groups blaming Pakistan for siding with the United States in its war on terror started attacking both its security forces and civilians.   Pakistani officials claim up to 80,000 of their citizens died in these attacks, and the country suffered up to $150 billion worth of damage to its economy.   In 2016, Pakistani cricket authorities formed the Pakistan Super League, six cricket teams representing six cities.

Zimbabwe Opening Victoria Falls to Vaccinated Tourists 	Zimbabwe ikutsegulira Victoria falls kwa alendo aku mayiko akunja omwe anabaitsa katemera
Zimbabwe is opening popular tourism destination Victoria Falls to visitors who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, in a move welcomed by the countrys suffering tourism industry.  Late Tuesday after a Cabinet meeting, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told reporters that the government had resolved to lift a lid on Victoria Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world and the countrys top tourism destination. 	Zimbabwe ikutsegula malo otchuka okopa alendo a ku mayiko a kunja Kwa alendo omwe analandira katemera wa COVID 19, mu zochitika zomwe zalandilidwa ndi gawo lokopa alendo lomwe lavutika.

"""[The] Cabinet acceded to a request by the tourism industry to open the Victoria Falls and Kazungula Border posts to tourists who are fully vaccinated. This is in view of the realization that over 60% of the population in Victoria Falls has been vaccinated. The lockdown measures, however, are being enforced throughout the country in order to curtail a surge under the third wave of COVID-19,"" Mutsvangwa said.   Godfrey Koti, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, says the pandemic had brought the tourism industry worldwide to its knees. He says it is time for Zimbabwe to begin the long climb back with the opening up of Victoria Falls, within the confines and guidelines of the COVID-19 pandemic.   ""And from a regional perspective, the tourism traffic will grow and this will send a very strong message to our source markets. This is a definite way of showing, of a benefit being shown from [the] governments drive of vaccinating the entire city of Victoria Falls and subsequently Victoria Falls reaching herd immunity. So, we are very excited to see this happening and it can only show that we are definitely moving in the right direction,"" Koti said.   About 1.5 million Zimbabweans out of a population of 14 million have received their first vaccination shot, and nearly 695,000 have received their second inoculation. "	"Ndunazi zamva pempho la gawo la zokopa alendo kuti atsegure Victoria falls komanso chipata cha mmalire cha Kazungula kwa alendo omwe analandira katemera mokwanira.

"Clement Mukwasi, a spokesman for Shearwater, one of the tourism operators in Victoria Falls, sounded an optimistic tone.  ""It is the industrys hope that towards the end of the pandemic – which we think we are in – there shall be some credit lines extended to the industry for the industry to recover. We applaud the government for taking our call to open the borders of Zambia and Botswana because Victoria Falls has reached its herd immunity. We are hoping that in addition to opening the borders, they are also going to set up a policy on how people should flow across all three countries,"" he said.  Mukwasi said those who are vaccinated should be allowed to move across the country without any problem, while those who are not vaccinated should produce results showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19.  Zimbabwe currently has 101,711 confirmed coronavirus infections and 3,280 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.   The government says the vaccination program will intensify after the arrival of more doses from China in the coming days. The number of cases has been rising, as the delta variant becomes more widespread. "	"Clement Mukwasi, oankhulira a Shearwater,amodzimwa oyendetsa Victoria Falls, anamveka ndi chiyembekezo chabwino.

UNHCR Voices Concern After Botswana Deports Zimbabwean Refugees 	UNHCR Voices yokhudzidwa dziko la Botswana litabweza anthu othawa kwawo a ku Zimbabwe
"The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says it is concerned after Botswana deported 57 Zimbabwean refugees who had lived in the host country since 2008. The refugees reportedly failed to register for voluntary repatriation, which led to their forced removal late last week.   The UNHCRs external relations officer, Kate Pond, says the refugees, irrespective of their status, have rights and could have been allowed to remain as permanent residents.  ""UNHCR remains concerned that Zimbabweans who have been in Botswana for over a decade have been removed to Zimbabwe in less than voluntary circumstances. Irrespective of their status they still have certain rights, and UNHCR had aimed for alternative solutions, like those provided to Zimbabweans who have family links in Botswana and may be able to remain in the country as permanent residents,"" Pond said.  One of the deported refugees, speaking on condition of anonymity, says they were rounded up Thursday and told to board a bus which took them to Zimbabwes border.  ""We left Botswana on empty stomachs. We were deported to the border and we didnt get any assistance. We wanted to remain in Botswana; thats why we did not register [for repatriation]. We have nothing, we dont know where to start. We had children going to school. It will be difficult without documents like passports and identity cards,"" the refugee said.  The deportees had been living at the Dukwi refugee camp. Botswanas government had warned that refugees who did not register would be deported.   Last month, Botswana sent back more than 200 other Zimbabweans who had registered for voluntary repatriation.  The repatriated refugees had initially refused to do so, citing fears of persecution in their homeland.  Most were opposition activists whose homes were burned down during a deadly presidential election campaign in 2008.  But one of the returnees, Bheki Weza, says they have surprisingly been well received in Zimbabwe despite their earlier safety concerns.  ""We are very happy about the situation. As we speak, I am now home still trying to settle down and adjust to the difficult economic conditions here in Zimbabwe. But I am happy because there is still peace surrounding us. I have met with the chiefs and even met with people that we fought with before I left. So far so good,"" Weza said.  The UNHCR says it will continue to assist refugees who were repatriated. Each person received $520 and a food package. But the agency says there will be no such assistance for the deported refugees. "	"Ofesi  ya U.N.

South Africa's Zuma to Pursue Private Prosecution Against Prosecutor  	Zuma wa ku South Africa aimba mlandu oimirira boma
Former South African President Jacob Zuma is pursuing private prosecution proceedings to remove the lead prosecutor in an arms deal corruption trial after failed legal challenges, his foundation said on Sunday.

Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s.

And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa. But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken."" "	Ie (Putin)
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts. 	Mmalo mwake, Calland anati, ogwirira ntchito dziko la South Africa akungotsatira mlingo oyikidwa ndi dzikolo pa nkhani ya mikangano ya kunja.
"""I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment,"" Calland said. ""Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak. And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue."" "	"""Ndimadziwa bwino komaanso ndili pafupi ndi anthu oona za ma ubale ndi maiko a kunja, ndipo anakhazikika mu chikhalidwe chimenechi chosagwirizana ndi maiko ena,""anatero Calland. ""kukambilana mu ndale ndilo dina lawo lina ponena mu njira ina.Ndipo ndikuganiza kuti pa ichi, amafuna kupitilira kusatenga mbali ndi cholinga  cholimbikitsa kukambilana."
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. 	"""Chifukwa china chopangitsa dzikoli kusaonetsa mbali mumkatikati mwa mgwirizano wa chuma wotchedwa BRICS, momwe muli mayiko a Brazil, Russia, India, China ndi South Africa."
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China. 	Katswiri anati dziko la South Africa litha kukhala kuti likufuna kusunga ubale wa malonda ndi mayiko a Russiandi China
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive. 	Koma katswiri pa ma ubale a mayiko a kinja Jeneberg anati ganizo ili ndilobwezeretsa mmbuyo kupindura kapena losapinduitsa.
"""In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse,"" Jernberg said. ""When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest."" "	"""Kotero tikutenga mbali yolakwika,"" Jenberg anatero. ""Mukayang'ana EU , mgwilizano wa mayiko a ku Europe ngati chimodzi, mgwilizano wa South Africa ndi EU ndi waukulu koposa. Ndiye ngati mutafuna kukamba za chuma,muzikamba izi mokhudzana ndi mayiko amu United States komanso mayiko aku Europe ndi umene ungabweretse phindu lambili la chuma."""
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future. 	Kaya cholinga ndi chani, ilo yasiya mbali ya mayiko a ku madzulo omwe ali mbali ya Eukrane atankhumudwa, ndipo anamandwa achenjeza patha kukhala zotsatira kwa South Africa mutsogolomu

Interpol Issues Red Notices for Gupta Brothers Wanted in South Africa 	Interpol yapeleka uthenga pa dziko lonse kuti anyamata a banja la a Gupta akufunika ku South Africa
South Africa said this week the International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has requested countries seek out and arrest Rajesh and Atul Gupta, two brothers and businessmen who allegedly bribed top officials, including former president Jacob Zuma, to gain lucrative government contracts.

"South African anti-corruption activists have accused the Guptas of ""state capture,"" a term meant to describe the brothers' strong influence over former president Zuma and members of his Cabinet — influence that allegedly extended to contracts, policy and personnel choices. "	Anthu omenyerera kutha kwa zinyengo ku South Africa anena a kwa Gupta wa kuti 'analinjata boma' mawu ogwilitsidwa ogwiritsidwa ntchito pofuna kutanthauza kuti anyamatawa anali ndi mphamvu yaikulu pa tsogoleri wa dziko opuma a Jacob Zuma komanso nduna zake - machitachita omwe anasefukira ku migwirizano ya malonda, lamulo komanso zisankho za umunthu pa yekha
While there are many allegations against the Guptas, the red notices — requests to member nations to arrest — were issued for a case involving a relatively small $1.5 million pertaining to procurement fraud. 	kugula makuba zazing'ono zokwana $1.5 million
South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority requested the red notices last year, but Rajesh and Atul Guptas' lawyers objected. The application had to be reviewed by Interpol to make sure, among other things, that there was no political bias. 	Bungwe loyimba anthu ,ilandu mu dziko la South africa la National Prosecuting Authority linapempha ma uthenga a dziko lonsewa chaka chatha koma oimilira milandu wa Rajesh ndi Atu Gupta anatsutsa.

Interpol's ambassador for the Turn Back Crime Campaign, Andy Mashaile, said South Africa also took time to secure an extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates, as it's believed the brothers are in Dubai.

Interpol has 194 member countries and, while red notices do not compel them to execute arrests, the notices do help in tracking the whereabouts of suspects or fugitives. Their photographs are posted on all local law enforcement systems.

Political analyst Sanusha Naidu of the Institute for Global Dialogue said the red notices could help the 2024 reelection campaign of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, because it shows he is taking action against corruption.

"""But I think what it also suggests is that at an international level, you know, getting the international community and, in particular, Interpol to also take a stance and align with the position that Ramaphosa has,"" Naidu said. ""So, I think in terms of him moving forward and trying to say to the South African public, I'm doing what I have to do. I'm working around this, I'm moving the needle on this."" "	""" Koma ndikuganiza kuti zomwe izi zikuonetsera ndi zakuti pa dziko lonse lapansi, mukudziwa inu, kupangitsa bungwe la dziko lonse la pansi makamaka la Interpol kuti litengepo gawo ndikulumikizana ndi ganizo lomwe Ramaphosa ali nalo,"" Naidu anatero.

However, Naidu said she's not sure it's enough to redeem the African National Congress, which has steadily been losing support at the polls because of rampant corruption and failure to deliver basic services.

"""I think if you want to talk about what ordinary South Africans want, they want to see the judicial system take its natural course,"" she said. ""But the question also is all the money that's been taken from the country, how does that come back? Because if you think about it, that's where part of the challenge lies.""
