Many of the non-monarchical Baganda had typically studied in secondary schools or worked in districts outside Buganda.	Abanganda bangi abataali mu bwakabaka baali basomedde mu masomero ga sekendule oba ne bakolera wabweru wa disitulikiti eziri wabweru wa Buganda.
Many Baganda often were married to non-Baganda, they usually studied in Kenya, India, Tanzania or Britain.	Abaganda bangi baateranga okufumbirwa nga abataali Baganda, baatera okusomera e Kenya, India, Tanzania oba e Bungereza.
Binaisa attended King's College Budo, a secondary school that during colonial times was the training ground for many of Uganda's future leaders.	Binaisa yasomera ku King's College Budo, essomero lya ssekendule eryali ettendekero ly'abakulembeze ba Uganda ab'ebiseera by'omu maaso mu biseera by'abafuzi b'amatwale.
Binaisa qualified as a lawyer in Britain in one thousand nine hundred fifty-five.	Binaisa yakuguka nga munnamateeka mu Bungereza mu lukumi mu lwenda ataano mu etaano.
He returned to Uganda in the year one thousand nine hundred fifty-six and plunged into the nationalist politics of the period.	Yakomawo mu Uganda mu lukumi mu lwenda ataano mu mukaaga era n'ayingirirawo ebyobufuzi mu kaseera ako.
He became Secretary-General of the newly formed Uganda National Congress.	Yafuuka Ssaabawandiisi wa Uganda National Congress eyali yaakatandikibwawo.
He became attorney general during first Uganda's People's Congress government of the one thousand nine hundred sixties.	Yafuuka ssaabawolerereza wa gavumenti ya Uganda People's Congress eyasooka myaka gya lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga.
Binaisa and two others over one night drafted a new constitution in the year one thousand nine hundred sixty-six.	Banaisa ne banne abalala babiri mu kiro ekimu baakola ssemateeka mu mwaka gwa lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga mu mukaaga.
That constitution paved way for the transformation of Uganda into a republic and eventually the abolition of the historical, traditional kingdoms.	Ssemateeka oyo yatondawo oluwenda lw'okukyusa Buganda okufuuka ettwale eritatambulira ku bufuzi bwa bwakabaka n'oluvannyuma ekyavaamu okuwera kw'obukulembeze obw'ennono.
This was the constitution that made Prime Minister Milton Obote the president and gave him what many viewed as dictatorial powers.	Ono ye ssemateeka eyafuula ssaabaminisita Milton Obote okufuuka Pulezidenti era n'emuwa amaanyi abamu ge baalaba nga agw'obwannakyemalira.
Binaisa fled into exile during the regime of Idi Amin Dada who was president from 1971 to 1979.	Binaisa yawanganguka ku mulembe gwa Idi Amin Dada eyali Pulezidenti okuva mu 1971 okutuuka mu 1979.
This period of waiting and hoping that the military government of President Idi Amin would be overthrown in a coup yielded nothing.	Ekiseera kino kyali kya kulindirira n'okusuubira nti gavumenti bamukwatammundu eya pulezidenti Idi Amin nti eyinga okumaamulwako mu ngeri yonna esoboka.
Finally, after clashes along the Uganda-Tanzania border in late one thousand nine hundred seventy-eight, Tanzania invaded Uganda.	Oluvannyuma, oluvannyuma lw'okulwanagana ku nsalo ya Uganda-Tanzania, Tanzania yalumba Uganda owaka gwa lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu mu munaana bwe gwali guggwako.
In March, the Tanzanian government organised a conference in the town of Moshi that brought together over twenty groups of exiled Ugandans.	Mu Gwokusatu, gavumenti ya Tanzania yateekateeka olukungaana mu kibuga Moshi olwagatta ebibinja bya Bannayuganda ebyasukka mu makumi abiri abaali mu buwanganguse.
Moshi Unity Conference soon revealed something disturbing.	Olukungana lw'obwegassi olw'e Moshi lwavaamu ebibala.
The extent of disunity, fighting, interest and power play among Uganda's political, intellectual and military elite.	Eddaala ly'enjawukana, okulwanagana, okweyagariza n'okulwanira obuyinza mu bannabyabufuzi ba Uganda abayivu era bannamagye.
The conference formed the Uganda National Liberation Front and elected Yusufu Lule, a former Principal of Makerere University College.	Olukungana lwatondawo Uganda National Liberation Front era ne lulonda Yusufu Lule eyaliko omukulu wa Makerere University College.
It was becoming apparent that the Amin government was about to collapse before the advancing Tanzanian army and armed Ugandan forces.	Kyali kitandise okulabibwa nti gavumenti ya Amin yali enaatera okugwa oluvannyuma lw'okulumbibwa kw'amagye ga Tanzania n'ebibinja bya Bannayuganda ebirwanyi.
When President Lule was voted out of office in June one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine, Binaisa was installed.	Pulezidenti Lule bwe yaggyibwa mu woofiisi mu Gwomukaaga gwa lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu mu mwenda, Binaisa yateekebwako.
President Lule was in office for only sixty-eight days.	Pulezidenti Lule yali mu woofiisi okumala ennaku nkaaga mu munaana zokka.
Binaisa rose to the presidency at a time of much national uncertainty.	Binaisa yajja ku bwa Pulezidenti mu kiseera ekizibu ennyo mu ggwanga.
He was a man the general public knew in one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine.	Yali musajja abantu bonna gwe baali bamanyi mu lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu mu mwenda.
Alarm spread through Uganda when Binaisa was named President.	Uganda yawaawaala nga Binaisa alangiriddwa nga pulezidenti.
Lule had been from the old intellectual and social tradition that viewed Uganda as a conservative Christian nation.	Lule yali ava mu Old Intellectual and Social Tradition abaalaba Uganda ng'eggwanga ly'Obukrisitaayo eritayagala nkyukakyuka.
Uganda was mapped after British tradition.	Uganda yeetengerera oluvannyuma lw'obufuzi bw'Abangereza.
Binaisa was part of that tradition but he also had the same radical socialist and pan-African outlook that Obote had.	Binaisa yali kitundu ku nfuga naye era ng'alina endowooza y'okubeera mu ggwanga eritaliimu bantu oba ggwanga erisukkulumye ku malala n'okwagala ennyo Afirika nga Obote ze yalina.
Many Baganda did not support Obote's aligning Uganda with what they regarded as the Communist, atheist Soviet bloc countries.	Abaganda bangi tebaawagira Obote ku ky'okuteeka Uganda mu luse lw'amawanga agalimu okuba ng'ebintu ebikozesebwa bya kitundu kyonna, ekibinja ekyali kikulemberwa Russia.
Once Binaisa became president, he was occupying State House in preparation for the return of Obote.	Binaisa bwe yafuuka Pulezidenti, yali mu maka g'obwa pulezidenti nga yeetegekera kudda kwa Obote.
Binaisa did not have real powers.	Binaisa teyalina buyinza bwe nnyini.
Like Lule, Binaisa proved to be an interim president.	Okufaanaganako ne Lule, Binaisa yalabika nga Pulezidenti ow'ekiseera.
He might have been the first East African head of state to occupy the office in preparation for another.	Ayinza okuba nga ye mukulembeze w'omu mawanga ga East Africa eyali agenze mu woofiisi ng'eteekerwateekerwa mulala.
Many political analysts, politicians and the news media concluded that their worst nightmare was about to come to pass.	Abatunuulizi b'eby'obufuzi bangi, bannabyabufuzi n'emikutu gy'amawulire gigamba nti ekirooto ekyabwe eky'entiisi kinaatera okujja.
Obote was being prepared for a second term as president.	Obote yali ateekebwateekebwa okuba pulezidenti omulundi ogwokubiri.
It could be argued with hindsight now that the instalment of Binaisa as president was the start of the civil war.	Kiyinza okulabibwa kati nga kimaze okubaawo nti okuteekako Binaisa nga Pulezidenti nti ye yali entandikwa y'obutabanguko.
The civil war would follow the one thousand nine hundred eighty general elections.	Obutabanguko bwandiddiridde okulonda kwa bonna okwa lukumi mu lwenda kinaana.
Obote was hated by most Baganda and resented by many non-Uganda People's Congress politicians.	Obote yali yakyayibwa Abaganda era nga tayagalibwa bannabyabufuzi abataali bannakibiina ba Uganda People's Congress.
Obote had become the most divisive figure in Uganda's post-independence history, more divisive even than Amin.	Obote yali ayawuddemu nnyo abantu nga Uganda efunye obwetwaze okusinga ne Amin.
Binaisa must have known this.	Binaisa alabika nga kino yali akimanyiiko.
Powerful former freedom fighters like David Oyite Ojok, Yoweri, former Ugandan president Godfrey Binaisa and his wife Tomoko Yamamoto.	Abaaliko abalwanirizi b'eddembe ab'amaanyi nga David Oyite Ojok, Yoweri, eyaliko Pulezidenti wa Uganda, Godfrey Binaisa ne mukyala we Tomoko Yamamoto.
August thirteenth to nineteenth two thousand ten, Museveni had hope of gaining and protecting power.	Okuva nga kkumi na ssatu okutuuka nga kkumi na mwenda Ogwomunaana nkumi bbiri mu kkumi, Museveni yalina essuubi ly'okufuna n'okukuuma obuyinza.
Museveni's only hope of gaining and protecting power would be to appeal to the influence of Tanzania's President Julius Nyerere.	Essuubi lya Museveni lyokka ery'okufuna n'okukuuma obuyinza lyandibadde mu kusaba kuyambibwako Pulezidenti wa Tanzania, Julius Nyerere.
Being from the fore mentioned generation of nationalistic minded Baganda, Binaisa sought to forge a sense of national unity and goodwill.	Olw'okuba yali ava mu mulembe gw'abogeddwako ogwa bamwoyogwaggwanga abalowooza ng'Abaganda, Binaisa yagezaako okutondawo obwasseruganda n'enkolagana ey'eggwanga lyonna.
He relied on goodwill and hoped for goodwill to prevail in the chaotic wake of the end of the Amin regime.	Yeesigama ku kukolera awamu era n'asuubira nti okukolaganira awamu kujja kugenda mu maaso kko n'obutabanguko okusobola okukomya obufuzi bwa Amin.
Binaisa felt that the only healing Uganda could hope for was holding elections on September one thousand nine hundred eighty.	Binaisa yawulira nga Uganda eyali etandise okudda engulu ekyali kirina okugiwonya kwe kutegeka okulonda mu Gwomwenda gwa 1980.
September one thousand nine hundred eighty elections were held under common front in which all shades of political opinion could be represented.	Okulonda kw'Ogwomwenda gwa lukumi mu lwenda kinaana kwaliwo wansi w'emikago ng'endowooza z'abantu zonna zikiikiriddwa.
The Moshi conference had been dominated by arguments among politicians, these same politicians rejected the idea of parties under one umbrella.	Olukungana lw'e Moshi lwali lujjuddemu endowooza za bannabyabufuzi, bannabyabufuzi bano be bamu baagana ekirowoozo ky'ebibiina okubeera mu mukago ogumu ogubigatta.
The umbrella idea was a pioneer in Ugandan politics of the idea of cooperation across party lines.	Ekirowoozo ky'omukago kwali kutandikawo endowooza y'ebibiina okukolaganira awamu mu byobufuzi bwa Uganda.
A forerunner to the post in 1986 in Uganda and the Inter-Party Cooperation today.	Akabonero ku kifo mu 1986 mu Uganda n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina byobufuzi leero.
He attempted to reshuffle his cabinet in May one thousand nine hundred eighty.	Yagezaako okukyusa ebifo mu baminisita be mu Gwokutaano gwa lukumi mu lwenda kinaana.
Yoweri Museveni Minister of Defence and Vice Chairman of Military Commission of Uganda National Liberation Front appointed Army Chief of Staff.	Yoweri Museveni minisita w'ebyokwerinda era amyuka ssentebe w'akakiiko k'amagye aka Uganda National Liberation Front yalonda omuduumizi omukulu ow'amagye.
David Oyite Ojok as ambassador to Algeria resulted in his removal from office.	David Oyite Ojok ng'omubaka wa Uganda mu Algeria kyamuviirako okumuggya mu woofiisi.
Many Ugandan politicians and opposition figures have discovered over the past thirty years that in Uganda the military has the final word.	Bannabyabufuzi mu Uganda bangi n'abooludda oluvuganya gavumenti bakizudde mu myaka asatu nti Uganda nti amagye ge galina ekigambo ekisembayo.
He was to discover as Lule, that Uganda remains a state where the military has the final word.	Ye yalina okuzuula nga Lule nti Uganda esigala ensi militale mw'erina ekigambo ekisembayo.
Even after the fall of Amin's regime, a wave of violent robberies, murders of prominent Ugandans and shooting at night suddenly erupted.	N'oluvannyuma nga Amin amaze okuvaako, omuyaga gw'obutabanguko gweyongera, abatemu abatemula bannayuganda abamanyifu n'okukuba abantu amasasi mu kiro byabalukawo.
It must have shocked and puzzled many of the idealistic educated Ugandans when shooting at night suddenly erupted.	Kiyinza okuba nga kya ntiisa n'okutabula Bannayuganda abayivu bangi ng'okukuba abantu amasasi ekiro kubaluseewo.
Since one thousand nine hundred seventy-one, the darkest and most barbaric deeds in the country's history had been perpetrated by Amin.	Okuva mu lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu mu gumu ebikolwa ebibi era eby'edda byayolesebwa Amin mu byafaayo by'eggwanga.
The first reaction to the post Amin violence was that these were remnants of Amin's army and State Research Bureau.	Ebyasooka okukolebwa ku butabanguko obwaddirira nga Amin avuddeko kyali nti akabinja k'amagye ga Amin akaasigalira ne State Research Bureau.
To this day, the two year period in Ugandan history remains a closed chapter.	Okutuuka ku lunaku luno, akaseera k'emyaka ebiri mu byafaayo bya Uganda tekaliddamu.
The murders of prominent Ugandans in one thousand nine hundred seventy nine were intended to portray Binaisa as incapable of managing security.	Abatemu abaatemula Bannayuganda abamanyifu mu lukumi mu lwenda kyenda mu musanvu baali bagenderedde okulaga nti Binaisa teyalina busobozi kukwasaganya byakwerinda.
Gunpoint of prominent Ugandans was to portray Binaisa as too weak to contain the deteriorating security believed some analysts and historians.	Abatunuuli b'ensonga ne bannabyafaayo abamu basuubira nti okuteeka bannayuganda abamanyifu ku mudumu gw'emmundu kyali kigendereddwa kulaga nti Binaisa yali munafu nnyo okukuuma ebyokwerinda ebyali bisereba.
Others claimed that these acts of violence were by the Uganda Peoples' Congress or parts of the army loyal to Obote.	Abalala baategeeza nti ebikolwa bino eby'obutabanguko byali bikolebwa Uganda People's Congress oba ebitundu ku magya agali gakkiririza mu Obote.
The acts of violence were to emphasize the point that without Obote, Uganda could not hope to stabilize.	Ebikolwa eby'obutabanguko bino byali bya kukkaatiriza nsonga nti, Obote w'atali, Uganda teyinza kutebenkera.
A bulky, simple man, Binaisa had an alert mind, was intelligent, humorous and very much the British educated African.	Omusajja amanyi ebintu ebingi, omwangu, Binaisa yalina obwongo obutegeera amangu, ow'essanyu era ng'ayagala nnyo Abafirika abaasomera e Bungereza.
Binaisa is quoted as having expressed distaste for Idi Amin partly because Amin spoke broken English.	Binaisa yawulirwa ng'agamba nti tayagalira ddala Idi Idi Amin kubanga Amin yayogera Olungereza olumenyefu.
Binaisa, in the remarks about Amin, betrayed the mentality of the earlier Ugandan elite, influenced and mesmerized by British culture.	Binaisa, ng'ayogera ku Amin, yalyamu olukwe endowooza ya Bannayuganda abaasooka okusoma, abeesigamye era ne bajjuzibwa obuwangwa bw'Abangereza.
Binaisa was of that era.	Binaisa yali wa biseera ebyo.
Amin once said the reason so many intellectuals in Uganda were so bitterly opposed to him was that he was a Muslim.	Amin lumu yagamba nti ensonga lwaki abayivu bangi mu Uganda baamuwakanya nnyo lwa nsonga nti yali Musiraamu.
He would have added key details to our understanding of Uganda's chaotic history.	Yaandigasseeko ebyongera okutunnyonnyola ku byafaayo by'obutabanguko bwa Uganda.
Having returned to Uganda in two thousand one, he had been reduced to a figure of fun in the eyes of Ugandans.	Oluvannyuma lw'okukomawo mu Uganda mu nkumi bbiri mu gumu, yali asigadde ku ddala lya Bannayuganda kumutunulako butunuzi.
He married a Japanese woman, Tomoko Yamamoto, as one of many coupled wedded via satellite link-up by the Unification Church.	Yawasa omukyala Omujapaani, Tomoko Yamamoto, ng'ogumu ku migogo gy'abaagalana egyagattibwa ku Unification Church okuyita ku mayengo ga seetirayiti.
He delivered a speech at the one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine Non Aligned Movement summit in Havana.	Yogera ku lukungaana lwa Non Aligned Movement mu Havan mu lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu.
News magazine photos at the time published photographs of journalists asleep in a heap as the Ugandan president spoke.	Ebifanaanyi by'amawulire mu kiseera ekyo byafulumya ebifaananyi bya bannamawulire nga beebase mu bifo mwe baali batudde nga Pulezidenti wa Uganda ayogera.
In that speech, he praised the restoration of peace and the rule of law to Uganda by the Tanzanian army.	Mu kwogera kwe, yatendereza okuzzibwawo kw'emirembe n'obukulembeze obutambulira ku mateeka mu Uganda ebyaleetebwa amagye ga Tanzania.
He stated that Tanzanian soldiers were now even dating or marrying Ugandan girls, much to the amusement of the assembled delegates.	Yategeeza nti abasirikale ba Tanzania akaseera kano boogerezeganya oba okuwasa abawala Abannayuganda, ekyasanyusa abakiise abaali mu lukiiko.
Had he not been appointed president, he would have remained unclear in the pages of Ugandan history.	Singa teyalondebwa nga Pulezidenti, yandisigadde nga tategeerekese mu bulungi mu mpapula z'ebyafaayo bya Uganda.
He was one of many well educated, internationally connected Ugandan intellectuals of no particular distinction.	Yali omu ku bayivu abangi, yakwataganya bannayuganda abayivu bangi mu bitundu eby'enjawulo.
An elderly man pays final respects to the late Godfrey Lukongwa Binaisa at Parliament on August tenth.	Omusajja omukadde akuba eriiso evvannyuma ku mugenzi Godfrey Lukonga Binaisa ku Paalamenti nga kkumi Ogwomunaana.
The casket bearing the body of the late Godfrey Lukongwa Binaisa was carried out of Parliament on August tenth.	Essanduuke erimu omubiri gw'omugenzi Godfrey Lukongwa Binaisa yali efulumizibwa Paalamenti nga kkumi Ogwomunaana.
The presidency of Godfrey Lukwongwa Binaisa has been the subject of much controversy.	Obukulembeze bwa Godfrey Lukwonga Binaisa bubaddemu nnyo emivuyo.
"In Uganda since independence, Professor Mutibwa characterises the Binaisa presidency as one of ""confusion, destruction and corruption."	Mu Uganda okuva lwe twafuna ameefuga, Pulofeesa Mutibwa annyonnyola obukulembeze bwa Binaisa ng'obwokutabulwa, obwonoonyi n'enguzi.
The role Binaisa played in evading the one thousand nine hundred sixty-two constitution remains controversial.	Omulimu ogwakolebwa Binaisa kulumbagana ssemateeka wa lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga mu ebiri gusigala nga tegutegeerekeka.
Fred Guwedeko in his serialised biographical account portrays Binaisa as opportunistic in his political views.	Fred Guwedeko ku bimwogerwako alaga nti Binaisa yali nakigwanyizi mu ndowooza ze ez'ebyobufuzi.
His fellow lawyer Peter Mulira wondered whether he was committed to his legal profession.	Munnamateeka munne Peter Mulira yeewunya oba yali yewaddeyo eri omulimu gwe ogw'amateeka.
Binaisa is no longer around to defend himself.	Binaisa taakyaliwo kwewozaako.
It is important for Ugandans to appreciate the circumstances at the time he inherited the highest office in the land.	Kya mugaso nnyo Bannayuganda okusiima embeera mwe yagendera mu woofiisi enkulu mu ggwanga.
It is important for Ugandans to appreciate the context of the environment they operated under.	Kya makulu Bannayuganda okutegeera embeera gye baakoleramu.
In one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine, Uganda's economy was in ruins; the country was under an increasingly unpopular occupational force.	Mu lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu mu mwenda, ebyenfuna bya Uganda byali mu matigga; ensi yali egenda mu maaso n'okweyongeramu ebbula ly'emirimu.
Coupled with all this, there were multiple conflicting parties fighting to fill the political vacuum left by strongman Idi Amin.	Ng'ogasseeko bino byonna, waaliwo ebibiina bingi ebyali birwanagana okujjuza ebifo by'ebyobufuzi ebyali birekeddwawo kirimaanyi Idi Amin.

"Mubatsi Asinja Habati said, ""If we can't defeat Al-Shabaab we leave their country"", because politics is a game of numbers."	"Mubatsi Asinja Habati yagamba nti ""Bwe tuba tetusaoba kuwangula Al Shabaab tuve mu nsi yaabwe"", kubanga ebyobufuzi muzannyo ogwesigamisibwa ku muwendo gw'abantu."

The road is in the Ankole Masaka cattle corridor, which is a semi desert, with very little rain and lots of dust.	Oluguudo luli mu kitundu ekigatta Ankole ku Masaka gye balunda ennyo ente, ekirimu ekyeya, kirimu enkuba ntonno nnyo n'enfuufu nnyingi.
We were hurrying to an interview with President Yoweri Museveni and that made us VIPs.	Twali twanguwa okukola yitaaviyu ne Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni era ekyo kyatufudde abakungu.
Usually, journalists would not travel 400km just to attend a press conference.	Bulijjo, bannamawulire tebatera kutambula kkiromita 400 okubeera mu lukiiko lwa bannamawulire.
The attacks were at Kyadondo Rugby grounds and an Ethiopian Restaurant in Kampala.	Obulumbaganyi bwali ku Kyadondo Rugby grounds ne ku Ethiopian restaurant mu Kampala.
On the morning after the attack, Museveni visited both places to view the carnage.	Kumakya oluvannyuma lwobulumbaganyi, Museveni yakyaala mu bifo byombi okulaba abattidwa.
He also visited Mulago Hospital to sympathize with the injured being treated there and console the bereaved.	Era yakyalako mu ddwaliro ly'e Mulago okusaasira ku baali baakoseddwa abaali bali mu kujjanjabibwa n'okukubagiza abaali bafiiriddwako abantu baabwe.
Why the President chose to have journalists ferried all the way from Kampala to tiny Ntungamo on the border with Rwanda, I will never know.	Sirimanya lwaki Pulezidenti yasalawo okutikka bannamawulire ku kiddyeri okuva e Kampala okugenda e Ntungamo ku nsalo ya Rwanda?
Journalists were put into several vans to head to Ntungamo.	Bannamawulire baateekebwa mu mmotoka ez'enjawulo okugenda e Ntungamo.
The journey was supposed to start at 1pm but began at 4:30pm instead and lasted six hours.	Olugendo lwali luteekeddwa kutandika ku ssaawa musanvu ez'omu ttuntu naye lwatandika ku ssaawa kkumi n'ekitundu ez'akawungenzi era ne lumala essaawa mukaaga.
After clearing the Masaka Mbarara, with its mounds of murram and dust we hit the Mbarara Ntungamo stretch.	Oluvannyuma lw'okutereeza oluguudo lwa Masaka Mbarara, olujjuddemu entuumu za mmalamu n'enfuufu twatuuka ku luguudo lw'e Mbarara Ntungamo.
We were running late and the event organizer, Uganda Media Centre boss Fred Opolot, kept leaning out of his dust-covered luxury Toyota Prado.	Twali tukeereye era omutegesi w'omukolo, akulira essengejjero ly'amawulire Fred Opolot, yagenda nga mu maaso n'okwesigama Toyota Prado ye eyali ejjudde enfuufu.
But the Coaster van carrying most journalists could not move any faster and Opolot soon sped off, probably to calm down the President.	Naye emmotoka ya mminibbaasi eyali erimu bannamawulire abasinga yali tesobola kudduka nnyo era Opolot yavaayo mangu okukkakkanya Pulezidenti.
The president's Ntungamo country home is on a murram road.	Amaka gw'Obwapulezidenti ag'e Ntungamo gali ku luguudo lwa mmalamu.
It was freezing cold when we arrived after 10pm and people fell over each other to grab a cup of hot tea.	Obude bwali bunnyogovu nnyo we twatuukira ku ssaawa nnya ez'ekiro abantu n'ebagwira okufuna ekikopo kya ccaayi ayokya.
Unlike, the Kampala crowd who, coming from a warmer place, wore no warm clothes, Museveni had on a checked black and white shirt .	Obutafaananako, abantu b'omu Kampala abava mu kifo ebirimu ebbugumu tebaayabala engoye zibuguma, Museveni yali ayambadde ebibomboola ebiddugavu n'essaati enjeru.
"""Two points,"" the president started as soon as the last journalists were ready."	Ensonga bbiri, Pulezidenti yatandika amangu ddala nga bannamawulire abaasembayo beetegese.
Opolot allowed one question for each journalist, except Al Jazeera who had requested a short one on one interview.	Opolot yakkiriza ekibuuzo kimi okuva eri buli munnamawulire, okuggyako Al jazeera eyali esabye okukola yintaaviyu ey'omu kw'omu.
When asked, Museveni said he was very angry about the bomb attacks which he blamed on the Somali radical Islamists group, AlShabaab. AlShabaab are angry that UPDF, under AU Mission in Somalia are propping up the regime, with Ethiopian support, outed them from power in 2006.	Bwe yabuuzibwa, Museveni yagamba nti yali munyiivu nnyo n'obulumbaganyi bwa bbomu bwe yateeka ku kibinja kya bamukwatammundu Abasiraamu abava e Somalia, Alshabaab. Alshabaab nnyiivu nnyo olwa UPDF wansi w'omukago gwa AU e Somalia oguwagira obukulembeze obuliko, n'obuwagizi bwa Ethiopia, obwabaggya mu buyinza mu 2006.
The African Union peace and United Nations Security Council took the decision to send peacekeepers to Somalia.	Ekitongole kya African Union Peace and United Nations Security Council kyakola okusalawo okusindika abakuumaddembe e Somalia.
Uganda and Burundi are the only countries to send troops there although many promised.	Uganda ne Burundi z'ensi zokka ezirna okusindika amagye wadde nga nnyingi zaasuubiza.
Now AlShabaab wants to bomb them out of Somalia.	Kati Alshabaab eyagala kubakuba bave mu Somalia.
But Museveni said he would instead push to change the African Union Mission to Somalia mandate.	Naye Museveni yagamba nti yali ajja kugenda mu maaso n'okukyusa ebigendererwa bwa African Union mu Somalia.
We were in Mogadishu doing our small bit of guarding the sea port, presidential palace and airport.	Twali mu Mogadishu nga tukuuma omwalo, olubiri lwa Pulezidenti n'ekisaawe ky'ennyonyi.
Museveni said withdrawing troops from Somalia is illogical because it would mean surrendering the African continent to terrorists.	Museveni yagamba nti okuggyayo amagye mu Somalia kya bwewussa kubanga kitegeeza okuwaayo ssemazinga wa Afirika eri abatujju.
He explained that he decided to send Uganda troops to Somalia because he knew the character of the terrorists .	Yannyongodde nti yasalawo okusindika amagye ga Uganda mu Somalia kubanga yali amanyi eneeyisa y'abattuju.
The president blamed the July 11 terror attacks in Kampala on the AlShabaab militants.	Obulumabaganyi obwakolebwa mu Kampala nga 11 Ogwomusanvu Pulezidenti abussa ku bamukwatammundu ba Alshabaab.
The Inspector General of Police Kale Kayihura responds to questions from journalist during the press briefing with the President .	Omuduumizi wa police Kale Kayihura addamu ebibuuzo bya bannamawulire mu lukungaana lwa bannamawulire ne Pulezidenti.
There were problems noted on the July 23rd to 29th 2010.	Waaliwo ebizibu ebyazuulibwa nga 23 okutuuka nga 29 Ogwomusanvu, 2010.
Watching him speak, I thought of the many people who oppose Museveni on Somalia.	Bwe nnamulaba ng'ayogera, nnalowooza ku bantu bangi abawakanya Museveni ku Somalia.
Dr Kizza Besigye, the leader of Uganda's biggest opposition party, says Uganda has no business being in Somalia.	Dr.Kizza Besigye, omukulembeze w'ekibiina ky'oludda oluvuganya ekisinga obunene agamba Uganda terina nsonga ya kubeera mu Somalia.
He says African countries like Nigeria and Malawi that promised troops have not sent them.	Agamba ensi za Afirika nga Nigeria ne Malawi ezaasuubiza amagye tezinnagasindika.
The Uganda Police Defence Force has been fighting all along, Ugandans are not told the truth that we are fighting on one side of civil war.	Uganda Police Defence Forece ebaade obudde bwonna erwanagana, Bannayuganda tebagambibwa kituufu nti tulwanira ku ludda lwe lumu n'abantu ba bulijjo mu lutalo.
I concluded that Museveni is better off using the chance for hosting the African Union to convince African leaders to choose a better strategy.	Mmaliriza nga ngamba nti kisingako Museveni okukozesa omukisa gw'okukyaza African Union okumatiza abakulembeze b'amawanga ga Afirika okulonda engeri ennungi.
One way would be to get more African Union states to send troops under African Union Mission to Somalia.	Engeri emu yandibadde ya kufuna ensi z'amawanga ga Afirika amagatte okusindika amagye mu Somalia wansi w'omukago gwa African Union.
Merely relying on Inter Governmental Authority Development might mean Uganda will remain in Somalia alone.	Okwemalira obwemalizi ku Inter Government Authority Development kiyinza okutegeeza nti Uganda ejja kusigala mu Somalia yokka.
Inter Governmental Authority Development comprises seven countries; Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan and Eritrea.	Inter Governmental Authority Development ekolebwa ensi musanvu; Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan ne Eritrea.
Inter Governmental Authority Development wants the troops increased from the current six thousand three hundred to twenty thousand.	Inter Governmental Authority eyagala abajaasi bongerebweko okuva ku baliyo akakaaga mu ebisatu okutuuka ku mitwaalo ebiri.
Eritrea, one of the three countries free to send troops to Somalia, is suspended.	Eritrea, emu ku nsi essatu ezirina eddembe okusindika amagye e Somalia, yawerebwa.
Sudan has never shown any interests in taking its soldiers to Somalia.	Sudan telagangako bwagazi mu kusindika magye mu Somalia.
If Uganda manages to get the African Union Mission to Somalia mandate changed but other African Union countries fail to send more troops.	Singa Uganda ekyusa ekiruubirirwa kya African Union mu Somalia naye ensi endala ne ziremererwa okusindika amagye amalala.
He explained that he had a house in Ntungamo because his ancestors were born in the present Ntungamo and Rukungiri districts.	Yannyonnyodde nti yalina ennyumba e Ntungamo kubanga bajjajja be baazaalibwa mu disituliki kati Ntungamo ne Rukungiri.
The journalists were told they would sleep in Mbarara, about 66kms away, and we immediately went back to our vehicles	Bannamawulire baagambibwa nti bandisuze e Mbarara, kkiromita nga 66 okuva mu kifo we baali, era ne tuddayo mangu mu mmotoka zaffe.
Most journalists, however, decided to drive through the night and were in Kampala at about 7pm.	Wabula, bannamawulire abasinga baasalowo okuvuga mu kiro era ssaawa yagenda okuwera emu eyoolweggulo nga batuuse mu Kampala.
The journalists arrived at 7:30 pm the next day.	Bannamawulire baatuka enkeera ku ssaawa emu n'ekitundu ey'akawungeezi.
On the journey back, along the bumpy and dusty road, I kept thinking how Museveni is a resolute man who will not flinch from a fight.	Mu lugendo nga bakomawo, mu nguudo ez'ebinnya n'enfuufu, nalowoozanga ku ngeri Museveni gyali omusajja omumalirivu ataliva ku kulwana.
But I was keenly aware that even powerful countries, like the USA, that have in the past attempted to pacify Somalia, have failed and fled.	Naye nali nkimanyi nti n'ensi ez'amaanyi nga USA, ezaagezaako emabega okuzza emirembe mu Somalia zaalemwa ne zivaayo.
It is too early to tell what Museveni and Uganda's road to Somalia might be like, but it is certainly bumpier than mine to Ntungamo.	Obudde bukyali okutegeera ki Museveni n'olugendo lw'e Somalia bwe lwandibadde, naye lwa binnya ng'olwange nga ngenda e Ntungamo.
Brian Bwesigye, on July 11th will go down in the history books as the day Uganda was thrown into a somber mood of shock, bitterness and panic.	Brian Bwesigye, nga 11 Ogwomusanvu lujja kugenda mu bitabo by'ebyafaayo ng'olunaku Uganda lwe yagenda mu mbeera enzimbu ey'ekyekango, enkaawu era ey'okupapa.
The twin bomb attacks in Kampala did not only turn an otherwise merry night into a tragic night of death and suffering.	Obulumbaganyi bwa bbomu ebbiri mu Kampala tezaafuuka bufuuzi ekiro ekyali ekirungi okufuuka eky'enjega y'okufa n'okubonaabona.
The AlShabaab, an Islamic extremist organization soon after claimed responsibility for the attacks that left 76 people dead.	Akabinja ka bamukwatammundu Abasiraamu aka Alshabaab oluvannyuma keewaana nga bwe kaali kakoze obulumbaganyi obwaleka abantu 76 nga bafu.
The attacks reignited the debate on Uganda's deployment of its troops for the African Union peace mission in Somalia.	Obulumbaganyi bwavaako okukubaganya ebirowoozo ku Uganda okutwala amagye gaayo ku kigendererwa kya African Union eky'okukuuma emirembe mu Somalia.
AlShabaab has warned Uganda and Burundi that there will be reprisals in Kampala and Bujumbura.	Alshabaab erabudde Uganda ne Burundi nti wajja kubaawo okuwoolera mu Kampala ne mu Bujumbura.
AU Mission in Somalia with UN mandate to protect the Somalia Transitional Federal Government and the shaky peace process in Somalia.	Ekyigendererwa kya AU mu Somalia ku kiragiro kya UN okukuuma Somalia Transitional Federal Government n'emirembe egyali giyuugayuuga mu Somalia.
AlShabaab, an extremist military organization linked to AlQaeda, the world's most deadly terror group, controls a larger part of Somalia.	Enteekateeka za bamukwatammundu ba Alshabaab zaamanyibwako Alqaeda, akabinja k'abayeekera akasinga okuba ak'obulabe mu nsi yonna akafuga ekitundu kya Somalia ekinene.
The forces that are currently in Somalia are understrength and underequipped the United Nations and European Union, among others.	Amagye agaali mu Somalia kati galina amaanyi era galina buli ekyetaagisa okuva mu United Nations and European Union, n'endala.
The hostile environment in which the forces operate creates insecurity for the troops.	Embeera enzibu amagye mwe gakolera eteekawo obutali butebenkevu eri amagye.
AlShabaab has killed dozens of African Union Mission to Somalia soldiers and injured many others.	Alshabaab esse abaserikare abasindikibwa African Union Mission bangi era ne balumya bangi.
Yet the troops face significant constraints on their ability to operate as the United Nations authorized mandate.	Ate amagye gasanga obuzibu mu kusobola okutuukiriza emirimu gyago ng'ekiragiro United Nations bwe kigamba.
This strategy puts the African Union Mission to Somalia troops in a delicate and vulnerable situation.	Enteekateeka eno eteeka ekigendererwa kya African Union eky'okusindika amagye mu Somalia mu bulabe era mu lusuubo.
AlShabaab fighters dress like civilians and use weapons that inflict mass casualties at once.	Abalwanyi ba Alshabaab bambala ng'abantu ba bulijjo era bakozesa ebyokulwanyisa ebirumya abantu bangi omulundi gumu.
African Union Mission to Somalia is thus a crippled mission that cannot defeat AlShabaab.	Ekyigendererwa kya African Union e Somalia kigootaanye nti tekisobola kuwangula Alshabaab.
Thus, as AlShabaab attacks Uganda for deploying troops in Somalia, Ugandan soldiers in Mogadishu have no mandate to fight the armed militia.	N'olw'ekyo, nga Alshabaab bw'erumba Uganda olw'okutwala amagye mu Somalia, abajaasi ba Uganda mu Mogadishu tebalina kiragiro kyonna kulwana ne bamukwatammundu.
Therefore this calls for a rethink of Uganda's security and foreign policy on Somalia.	N'olw'ekyo kino kyetaagisa ebyokwerinda bya Uganda okuddamu okulowooza n'ensonga z'ebweru ku Somalia.
From the outpouring emotion and reaction among the Ugandan public, two important opinions on what citizens want the country to do come up.	Okuva ku mbeera embi bannayuganda gye balimu n'ebiva mu bantu, ensonga bbiri ez'omugaso bannansi ze baagala eggwanga liveeyo nazo.
One, that Uganda should hunt down AlShabaab so as to disable them and save the world from terror attacks.	Ekisooka, nti Uganda erina okuyigga Alshabaab esobole okubalemesa n'okutaasa ensi okuva mu bulumbaganyi bw'abatujju.
Another is that Uganda should withdraw from Somalia and beef up its national security.	Endala eri nti Uganda erina okuva mu Somalia enyweze ebyokwerinda byayo.
If we have no peace and security in Uganda, the citizens have a right and duty to ask their state to withdraw its forces and maximize security here.	Bwe tuba nga tetulina mirembe na bukuumi mu Uganda, bannansi balina eddembe n'omulimu okusaba gavumenti okuggyayo amagye gaayo okunyweza wano obukuumi.
We can contemplate a mission to hunt down AlShabaab when we are assured of our own security.	Tusobola okulowooza ku kigendererwa ky'okuyigga Alshabaab nga tumaze kunyweza ebyokwerinda by'eggwanga lyaffe.

It has thus attacked African Union Mission to Somalia troops and warned it will continue to attack the citizens of the contributing states.	N'olw'ekyo erumbye amagye agaatwali African Union mu Somalia era n'erabula nti ejja kwongera okukola obulumbaganyi ku bannansi b'ensi eziriyo.

We have got less than two hundred days to 2011 elections but the Uganda opposition has failed to convince the voters.	Ennaku ze tusigazzaayo teziwera na 100 okutuuka ku kulonda kwa 2011 naye oludda oluvuganya lukyalemeddwa okukakasa abalonzi.
Mao's Democratic Party and Bidandi Ssali's party are fighting the Interparty Cooperation.	Democratic party ya Mao n'ekibiina kya Bidandi Ssali balwanyisa omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi.

The opposition should, for instance, have a policy on Universal Primary and Secondary Education .	Oludda oluvuganya lulina, okugeza, okubeera n'enkola za bonnabasome wa Pulayimale n'owa Sekendule.
When President Museveni introduced Universal Primary Education in 1997 after the 1996 elections, it won him a lot of support,	Pulezidenti Museveni bwe yatandikawo bonnabasome wa Pulayimale mu 1997 oluvannyuma lwa 1996, kyamuwa obuwanguzi bungi.
In 2006, when he went back to the population, he reminded them of the Universal Primary Education.	Mu 2006, bwe yaddayo mu bantu, yabajjukiza bonnabasome owa Pulayimale.
Museveni promised the peasants Universal Secondary Education if they voted him.	Museveni yasuubiza abantu ba wansi bonnabasome owa singa bamulonda.

To the very best of my understanding, Rwanda had a very strong feudal structure at the onset of European colonization.	Mu kutegeera gwange, Rwanda yalina enkola y'obwannannyini ku ttaka ennungi ng'abafuzi b'amatwale baakajja.
However, the invading Europeans were already well beyond feudalism.	Wabula, Abazungu abajja baali bamalirivu okwonoona enkola y'obwannannyini ku ttaka.
The demise of feudalism in Europe brought up much of the territorial nationalism.	Okuggyawo obwannannyini ku ttaka mu Bulaaya kyaleetaawo okulwanira amatwale.

In order to first discuss the Al-Shabaab latest terror missions.	Okusobola okusooka okukubaganya ebirowoozo ku nnumba za Al-Shabab azaakaggwa.
It transpired at the summit that of the many challenges facing Africa, the search for peace and security remains the most pressing.	Kyagwawo ku lukkungaana nti ku kusomooza okungi Afirika kw'esanga, okunoonya eddembe n'obukuumi kisigala nga kye kisinga obukulu.
The August 31 2009 three cities declaration constrains states to deal with the burden of conflicts and violence on the continent.	Okulangirira kw'ebibuga ebisatu nga 31 Ogwomunaana 2009 kikaka amawanga okukola ku kizibu ky'obukuubagano n'obutabanguko ku ssemazinga.
This done by committing resources.	Kino ekikolebwa ng'oteemamu ebintu.
The lastest victim of the conflict troubling many parts of Africa is Uganda which lost 74 people in the July 11 bomb blasts.	Akyasembyeyo okukosebwa obutabanguko mu bitundu bya Afirika ebingi ebisoomoozebwa ye Uganda eyafiirwa abantu 74 mu kubwatuka kwa bbomu nga 11 Ogwomusanvu.

"""Who are they and whose interest do they represent?"" , Museveni charged."	Museveni yabuuzizza, be b'ani era batuukiriza bigendererwa by'ani?
The Al-Shabaab attacks showed, as Rose Asha Migiro the United Nations Deputy Secretary General said that no country is immune to terrorism.	Obulumbaganyi bwa Al-Shababa bwalaga, nga Rose Asha Migiro amyuka wa ssaabawandiisi w'amawanga amagatte yagambye nti tewali ggwanga litasobola kulumbibwa batujju.
Migiro thus called upon the AU states to implement the UN Counter terrorism strategy.	Migiro n'olw'ekyo yakubira amawanga ga AU omulanga okuteekawo enkola za UN ezirwanisa obutujju.
Implement it with a global response rooted in the rule of law and respect for human rights.	Kiteeke mu nkola n'okkukiriziganya kw'ensi yonna mu tteeka n'okussa ekitiibwa mu ddembe ddembe ly'obuntu
However, as united as the African Union leaders were on terror, so were they on shielding African leaders indicted on terrorism.	Naye nga obumu abakulembeze b'amawanga ga Africa amagatte bwe baalina ku butujju, era bwe baakolanga okubikkirira bakulembeze ba Afirika abavunaanibwa obutujju.
Mutharika, for example, argued that the arrest warrant by the ICC against Sudan President Omar Bashir undermines African solidarity.	Okugeza, Mutharika yagamba nti ekiwandiiko kya ICC ekiragira okukwata pulezidenti wa Sudan Omar Bashir kityoboola omwoyo gw'Abafirika obuteelyamu lukwe.
it also undermines peace and security that Africans fought so hard to get.	Era kityoboola eddembe n'obutebenkevu abaddugavu bye baalwanirira ennyo okufuna.
The African Union leaders agreed to oppose Bashir's accusation.	Abakulembeze b'amawanga amagatte aga Afirika bakkaanya okuwakanya okuvunaanibwa kwa Bashir.

This remains a serious gap on the African Union's commitment to rid Africa of dictators and conflict.	Guno gusigala nga muwaatwa minene eri obumalirivu bw'ekibiina ky'amawanga ga Africa amagatte okumalawo bannakyemalira n'obukuubagano mu Africa .
On maternal and child development in Africa, Thoraya Obaid, the Executive Director of the UNPF said poverty, illiteracy are major hindrances.	Ku kuzaala n'okukuza omwana mu Afirica,Thoraya Obaid, ssenkulu wa UNPF yagamba obwavu, obutasoma miziziko minene.
Obaid argued that, most women who die while giving birth do not seek proper healthcare either because they cannot afford the cost.	Obaid yagamba nti abakyala abasinga abafa nga bazaala tebafuna bujjanjabi bulungi oba kubanga tebasobola kusasula bisale.
Or because they do not consider it important.	Oba kubanga tebakitwala nga kya mugaso.
Bience Gawanas, Africa Union's commissioner for social affairs said, every pregnant woman is likely to die during child birth.	Bience Gawanas, omubaka akola ku ensonga z'abantu mu kibiina ky'amawanga ga Africa amagatte yagamba, buli mukyala w'olubuto alinga ow'okufa ng'azaaala
A woman in Sub-Saharan Africa has 1 out of 16 chances to die during pregnancy or childbirth.	Omukyala mu Sub-Saharan Africa alina alina omukisa gumu ku kkumi na mukaaga okufa ng'ali lubuto oba ng'azaala.
This is compared to 1 out of 4,000 chance in developed countries.	Kino kigeraageranyizibwa n'omukisa gumu ku nkumi ennya mu mawanga agaakulaakulana.
Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest risk of maternal mortality among the poor and rich countries.	Ekitundu kya Africa ekiri wansi w'eddungu Saharah kye kisingamu abaana abafa nga bawere mu nsi enjavu n'engagga.
In September 2001, a total of 147 heads of state endorsed Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.	Mu Gwomusanvu 2001, omugatte gw'abakulembeze b'amawanga 147 baasemba ebiruubirirwa by'enkulaakulana by'ensi yonna ekyokuna n'ekyokutaano.
That bleeding is one of the top causes of maternal death and can be caused by failure of the uterus to contract before, during or after child birth.	Okuvaamu omusaayi okwo kwe kuviirako bamaama okufa nga bazaala era nga kisobola okuleetebwa kw'okulemererwa kwa nnabaana okugaziwa nga tannazaala n'okufunda oluvannyuma lw'okuzaala.
Byamugisha cheered the African Union for giving maternal and infant mortality top priority on the summit agenda.	Byamugisha yawagira ekibiina ky'amawanga ga Afirica amagatte okukulembeza eky'abamaama abafa nga bazaala n'abaana abawere abafa ku nteekateeka y'olukugaana.
The Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development Gabriel Opio told the summit that the government would commit $30 million.	Minisita w'ekikula, abakozi n'enkulaakulana y'abantu Gibriel Opio olukugaana nti gavumenti yandiwaddeyo obukadde bwa ddoola 30.
This would be for reproductive health.	Kino kyandibadde kya kutumbula byabulamu bya kuzaala.
The AU theme predicted a future when the African woman nolonger has to die during childbirth because there is not enough health care for her.	Omulamwa gwa AU gwateebereza ebiseera by'abakazi ba Afirika eby'omu maaso nga tewali mukazi afa ng'azaala olw'obutabeerawo bujjanjabi bwe bumala.
Al-Shabaab terror attacks hijack African Union summit agenda.	Obulumbaganyi bwa Al-Shabaab bugootaanya enteekateeka y'olukuggaana lw'amawanga ga Afirica amagatte.
Many in the crowd recall that Butambala County was previously under Mpigi district but is now Gomba district.	Abantu bangi bajjukira nti emabegako essaza ly'e Butambala lyali mu disitulikiti y'e Mpigi naye kati ye disitulikiti y'e Gomba.
Two disastrous events in the last twelve months have shaken the centuries old kingdom.	Ebintu eby'obulabe bibiri mu myezi kkumi n'ebbiri egiyise biyuuguumizza Obwakabaka obumaze ebyasa .
The September 2009 riots over the blocking of the kabaka from travelling to Kayunga a province of his kingdom.	Okwegugunga bw'Ogwomwenda oluvannyuma lwa Kabaka okugaanibwa mu ssaza lye ery'e Kayunga.
This touched off a deadly riot and led to the closure of the kingdom's radio station CBS.	Kino kyaviirako obwegugungo obw'obulabe ekyaviirako n'okuggalawo kw'omukutu gwa leediyo ya CBS.
Kingdom spokesman, Charles Peter Mayiga says there is little for Buganda to celebrate.	Omwogezi w'Obwakabaka, Charles Peter Mayiga agamba nti tewali nsonga nnene ereetera Buganda okujaguza.
Considering the obstacles they have faced from the central government.	Okusinziira ku miziziko gye bafunye okuva mu gavumenti ya wakati.
Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II was crowned on July 31, 1993.	Kabaka Ronald Mwenda Mutebi II yattikirwa nga 31 Ogwomunaana, 1993.
This was twenty-seven years after Buganda kingdom was suspended along with other kingdoms in Uganda by President Milton Obote.	Wano gyali emyaka abiri mu musanvu okuva Obwakabaka bwa Buganda lwe bwali bwawerebwa Pulezident Milton Obote wamu n'Obwakabaka obulala mu Uganda.
Since his installation at Naggalabi, Budo, Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II has largely had cold relations with the NRM government.	Okuva lwe yatikkirw e Naggalabi, Budo, Kabaka Ronald Mwenda Mutebi II abadde takwataganira ddala ne gavumenti ya NRM
This government which is curiously led by his former friend Yoweri Museveni.	Gavumenti eno efugibwa eyali mukwano gwe Yoweri Museveni.
Mayiga says, the government owes Buganda kingdom about Shs 20 billion in rental debts for the use of land and facilities.	Mayiga agamba, Obwakabaka bwa Buganda bubanja gavumenti obuwumbi obuli mu 20 ku kukozesa ettaka n'ebintu ebirala .
This claim is linked to the unresolved question involving the historical 9000 square miles of land.	Bagamba nti kiva ku kubuuzo ekitannagonjoolwa ekizingiramu mmayiro z'ettaka akenda.
This was vested in the hands of the Buganda Land Board at independence.	Lino lyateekebwa mu mikono gya Buganda Land Board okuva ku meenunula.
Mengo officials harbor the view that the solution to Uganda's political problems is the restoration of a federal system of governance.	Abakungu b'e Mengo bagamba nti eddagala ekinagonjoola ebizibu ky'ebyobufuzi bya Uganda kwe kuzzaawo enfuga ya federo.
This is a demand government has clearly been cold about.	Lino bbanja gavumenti ly'ebadde tefiirako ddala.
The closest the two sides came to a solution was in 2005.	Enjuyi ebbiri zaatuuka ku nzikiriziganya mu 2005.
This was when a high powered Buganda delegation led by then Katikkiro Joseph Mulwanyammuli Ssemogerere.	Kino kyaliwo olukiiko lw'abakungu b'Obwakabaka abaateekebwamu ennyo amaanyi katikkiro Joseph Mulwanyammuli Ssemwogerere.
The Buganda legislative body, the Lukiiko, threw it out arrogantly and Mulyanyamuli went with it.	Olukiiko lwa Buganda lwakisuula ebbali Mulwanyammuli n'agenda nakyo.
Mulwanyammuli is now back to torture Museveni through his association with the Inter party co-operation and Ssuubi 2011.	Mulwanyammuli kati akomyewo okutulugunya Museveni ng'ayita mukukolagana n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ne Ssuubi 2011.
Mayiga was part of the Buganda negotiation team that agreed to the regional ranking.	Mayiga yali kitundu ku ttiimu ya Buganda eyakola enteeseganya n'ekkiriziganya ku kusengeka ebitundu.
He now says the kingdom could not stant the requirement to have an elected Katikkiro.	Kati agamba nti Obwakabaka tebusobola kutuukiriza bisaanizo bya kulonda Katikkiro.
This was one incurable weakness since they wanted the current situation to remain whereby the Kabaka names the Katikkiro.	Guno bwali bunafu bwa maanyi kubanga baali baagala embeera eriwo esigalewo nga Kabaka y'alonda Katikkiro.
The government argues that an unelected Katikiro defeats the democratisation crusade.	Gavumenti egamba nti Katikkiro atannalondebwa alemesa demokolasiya okukola.
This is because it removes the people of their right to elect their leaders.	Kino kiri bwe kiti kubanga kiggyako abantu eddembe lyabwe okulonda abakulembeze baabwe.
They argue further that a Katikkiro appointed by the Kabaka is hard to hold accountable.	Bongererako nti Katikkiro alondeddwa Kabaka kizibu a kuvunaana.
Because the Baganda treat their Kabaka with near faultlessness.	Kubanga Abaganda tatwaka Kabaka waabwe ng'atakola nsobi.
Mayiga also said that the regional ranking agreement did not provide resources for the regional government.	Mayiga naye yagamba nti enzikiriziganya y'ensengeka y'ebitundu teyateerawo gavumenti za bitundu bintu.
The Buganda demand for Ebyaffe, a demand for government to honour this suggestion is fueled by the kingdom's claim.	Buganda esaba ebyaffe, ebbanja lya gavumenti ly'erina okukolako erikumibwamu okwemulugunya kw'Obwakabaka.
Many Baganda believe the claim, including those who support the NRM such as former Luwero chairperson, Abudul Naduli, a Luwero veteran.	Abaganda abasinga bakkiriza me byogerebwa omuli abo abawagira NRM okugeza eyaliko ssentebe w'e Luwero Abudul Nadduli, eyazirwano w'e Luwero .
According to Nadduli, it was president Museveni's promise to restore the kingdom to its former status after he overthrew the UPC government.	Okusinziira ku Nadduli, kyali kisuubizo kya Pulezidenti Museveni okuzzaawo Obwakabaka mu mbeera gye bwalimu oluvannyuma lw'okuggyako gavumenti ya UPC.
Nadduli, on the other hand adds that he is satisfied with what the NRM government has provided to the Buganda kingdom.	Nadduli, ku ludda olulala ayongerako nti mumativu n'ekyo gavumenti ya NRM oky'ewadde Obwakabaka bwa Buganda.
He argues that by allowing the coronation in 1993, recognising the kingdom in the 1995 constitution and granting the regional rank.	Agamba nti okukiriza amattikira mu 1993, okuzzaawo Obwakabaka mu ssemateeka wa 1995 n'okubuwa ekifo we ligwa.
However, they have occasionally appeared to make acknowledgement to the Central Government.	Newankubadde, ebiseera ebisnga balabise nga basiima gavumenti eya wakati.
Kingdom officials have been discouraged from openly campaigning against the ruling party in 2001 and again in 2006 national election.	Abakungu b'Obwakabaka babadde bagaanibwa okukuba kakuyege mu lwatu atali ku ludda lw'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza mu 2011 era ne mu kulonda kwa bonna mu 2006.
When tough talking Katikkiro Daniel Muliika was relieved of his duties as prime minister of Buganda after less than one year in office.	Katikkiro omukambwe Daniel Muliika bwe yali aggyiddwako obuvunaanyizibwa bwe obwa Katikkiro wa Buganda nga tannaweza mwaka mu woofiisi.
For now, Kabaka Mutebi's predicament has atleast not yet deteriorated to the extent of his father's, Sir Edward Mutesa 1.	Kati, embeera ya Kabaka Mutebi ey'obuswavu waakiri tennatuuka ku ssa lya kitaawe, Sir Edward Muteesa 1.
Mutesa was exiled to London twice; from 1953 to 1955 and again in 1966 until his death in 1969.	Muteesa yawaggaangusibwa mu London emirundi ebiri; okuva mu 1953 okutuuka 1955 era ne mu 1966 okutuuka mu 1969.
Initially, he had problems with the British and later with Apollo Milton Obote.	Okusookera, yalina obuzibu n'Abangereza oluvannyuma ne Apollo Milton Obote.
In the seventeen years he has reigned, Mutebi, like his father, has repeatedly come head-to-head with the government.	Mu myaka ekkumi n'omusanvu gye yali abazeeko, nga kitaawe, yavuganyanga ne gavumenti emirundi mingi.
As the Baganda celebrate, they will be eyeing the February 2011 national elections.	Ng'Abaganda bwe bajaguza, bajja kuba batunuulidde okulonda kwa bonna mu 2011.
They will be hoping to possibly squeeze some rights out of Museveni's government.	Bajja kuba basuubira okukamula ekituufu mu gavumenti ya Museveni.
A number of aggressive operations against ADF operations in and around Kampala and a number of key collaborators have been captured.	Ebikwekweto ebyentiisa ebiwerako byakolebwa ku ADF mu Kampala era abakolagana nabo bangi bakwatiddwa.
Some killed and others are still on the run.	Abamu battibwa n'abalala bakyayiggibwa.
Those who escaped arrest are suspected to have moved to their hideouts in Eastern DRC, Nairobi and others have gone into hibernation.	Abo abataakwatibwa basuubirwa okubeera mu buvanjuba bwa DRC, Nairobi ate abalala bakyekukumye.
The aim of this presentation is to update you on the current Justice Action and Truth operations carried out against ADF terrorism.	Ekiruubirirwa ky'omusomo kwe kubamanyisa ebipya ku bikolwa by'obwenkanya ebiriwo n'ebikwekweto eby'amazima ebikolebwa ku bayeekera ba ADF.
National Resistance Movement and Rwandan Patriotic Front had a bias to violence as a means of resolving political problems.	National Resistance Movement ne Rwandan Patriotic Front baalina tebaagala kukozesa mivuyo ng'engeri y'okugonjoolamu ebizibu by'ebyobufuzi.
Museveni was wrong in sending troops to Somalia.	Museveni yali mukyamu okusindika amagye e Somalia.
Mwenda are you assuming that a war is fought with clear objectives and ideologies that everyone can easily identify?	Mwenda, osuubira nti olutalo lulwanibwa n'ebiruubirirwa ebimanyiddwa buli omu byangu bya kuzuula?
Do you think that Museveni can clearly state why he sent his troops to Somalia?	Olowooza nti Museveni asobola okwogera lwaki yasindika amagye ge mu Somalia?
The stability of Somalia is not clear from Museveni's intentions.	Obutebenkevu bwa Somalia tebumanyiddwa bulungi okuva ku igendererwa bya Museveni.
However, the Somali disaster has become more internationalised because of its Al Qaeda connections.	Newankubadde, obuzibu bwa Somalia buufuse bwa nsi yonna olw'okwegatta ku Al Qaeda.
Museveni is there for his personal gains.	Museveni aliwo ku lw'ebigendererwa bye ng'omuntu.
He's basically exploiting the need for Americans to fight anti-Americanist jihadists.	Ky'akola kwe kukozesa obwetaavu bw'Abamerika okulwanisa anti-Americanist jihadists.
Principally Al Qaeda that has found and enjoyed the sympathy with Al Shabaab.	Gye buli kati Al Qaeda eyatandikibwawo enyumiddwa enkwatagana ne Al Shabaab.
By taking a pro western position, the Western powers respond by not influencing the change of power against its Uganda personal leadership.	Mu kubeera ku ludda lw'Abazungu, ensi z'Abazungu zisalawo obutafaayo ku kukyusa obuyinza ku bukulembeze bwa Uganda.

The ease with which Mutabazi shakes off his figures is impressive and partly a common feature of Rwandan society.	Obwangu Mutabazi kw'avvuunukirako obuzibu busanyusa era nga kitera okweyolekera e Rwanda.
Kagame's 93% win marks a new era Perfect finish.	Obuwanguzi bwa Kagame obw'ebitundu kyenda mu ssatu ku kikumi bulaga obuwanguzi obuggya.
Many people are wearing Kagame and his party campaign gifts.	Abantu bangi bambala ebirabo bya Kagame n'ekibiina kye bye baafuna mu kunoonya akalulu.
However, a one 52 year old man who is known as Jack Mutabazi a resident and peasant of rural Bugesera, stands out.	Wabula, omusajja omu ow'emyaka ataano mu ebiri amanyiddwa nga Jack Mutabaazi omutuuze era omulimi ku kyalo Bugesera, avuddeyo.
He is emotionally involved in cheering Kagame dancing, jumping up and down, and singing at the top of his voice.	Obwongo bwe n'ebirowoozo bye abitadde ku kusuuta Kagame ng'azina, abuukabuuka wamu n'okuyimba mu ddoboozi ery'omwanguka.

You do not understand what Kagame has done for us ordinary Rwandans.	Totegeera kiki Kagame ky'atukoledde ffe Abanyarwanda ab'eddaala erya wansi.
I had taken note of 32 year old Beatrice Nyirimana, who had been dancing with a wild dance.	Nali mmaze okukenga Beatrice Nyirimana ow'emyaka asatu mu ebiri eyali amaze ekiseera ng'azina amazina mu ngeri ey'okwefukula.
A reprimand was given and the domestic violence ended after reporting her husband to local authorities.	Okulabulwa okuva mu boobuyinza kwaweebwa era okutulugunyizibwa mu maka ne kukoma oluvannyuma lw'okuwawaabira bba eri aboobuyinza mu kitundu.
People in Rwanda feel shy or afraid or both to talk about their background.	Abanyalwanda bawulira ensonyi oba okutya sinakindi byombi okwogera ku buvo bwabwe.
She says passionately at the top of her voice that she supports Mzee Kagame because he has liberated women from oppression.	Ayogera n'okwagala era ng'aleekaanira waggulu nti awagira muzeeyi Kagame kubanga anunudde abakyala okuva mu kulinnyirirwa.
Nyirimana immediately turned to her friend who was laughing shyly next to her.	Nyirimana amangu ddala yakyukira mukwano gwe eyali amuliraanye ng'aseka yeebwalabwala.
Nyirimana's husband later abandoned her but not before he sold their family land.	Bba wa Nyirimana oluvannyuma yamusuulawo naye yasooka kutunda ttaka lyabwe okwali amaka.
Through the government's land program, Nyirimana was given a plot of land for free.	Nyirimana yaweebwa ettaka ery'obwerere ng'ayita mu nteekateeka ya gavumenti.
"""Mzee is for women's rebalation,"" she says with satisfaction and goes back to singing, Kagame is ours; we are going to vote for him."	Muzeeyi aliwo ku lwa bakyala, bw'agamba n'obumativu era addamu okuyimba nti Kagame waffe; tugenda kumuwa akalulu.
Nyirimana's eagerness is a feeling I have encountered at all Kagame gatherings ordinary men, women and youths singing and dancing wildly.	Obwagazi bwa Nyirimana kintu kye nzudde ku nkugaana za Kagame zonna ng'abasajja, abakyala n'abavubuka bayimba n'okuzina nga beetinkuula.
For those who covered the campaign, it was not surprising that Kagame got 93 percent of the vote.	Eri abo abaakwatanga amawulire mu kunoonya akalulu, kyali tekyewuunyisa nti Kagame yafuna ebitundu kyenda mu bisatu ku kikumi eby'obululu.
But his opponents could hardly get a crowd of 500 at their gatherings.	Naye banne abamuvuganya kyalinga kizibu okufuna abantu ebitaano mu nkungaana zaabwe.
Kagame's were running above 100,000.	Aba Kagame baali basoba mu mutwalo gumu.
A crowd attends a Railway Protection Force campaign gathering addressed by the incumbent, President Paul Kagame.	Ekibinja ky'abantu kyali ku lukungaana lw'enteekateeka y'okutaasa oluguudo lw'eggali y'omukka olw'akubirizibwa Pulezidenti aliko Paul Kagame.
But for many women the love and adoration of Kagame is clearly recognised.	Naye okwagala n'okuyaayaanira Kagame kweyolekera ddala butereevu mu bakazi bangi.
Given the general perceptions about extreme unfriendliness between Hutus and Tutsis.	Okusinziira ku ndowooza ey'awamu ku butabeererako baamukwano wadde wakati w'Abahutu n'Abatuusi.
The story of deeply rooted ancients hatreds among African ethnic groups is one of those grand distortions of our history.	Emboozi y'obukyayi ey'edda ennyo mu mawanga ga Afirika kimu ku ebyo ebisinze okutaataaganya ebyafaayo byaffe.
Rwandan politics appears to shake that.	Ebyobufuzi bya Rwanda birabika okumalawo ekyo.
"At many of his campaign gatherings, I have heard Kagame say: ""There are no hutus, tutsis and twa in Rwanda"", we are all Rwandans."	Mu kampeyini ze ezisinze, mpulidde Kagame ng'agamba nti tewali Bahutu, Batuusi n'Abatwa mu Rwanda, ffenna tuli banyarwanda.
Previous regimes in Rwanda had promoted the ideas of Hutu power with unequalled effectiveness and had succeeded beyond measure.	Emirembe egizze gibaawo mu Rwanda gyali gitaddewo embeera y'okusukkulumya Abahutu nga kyali kyekubidde ne kibalema okukwasaganya.
Post racial killing, Rwanda has been trying to burry these ethnic demons.	Ekittabantu ekizze kibaawo, Rwanda ezze ng'egezaako okuziika emizimu gino.
Rwanda's challenge is to sustain this momentum to the next generations.	Okusoomoozebwa kwa Rwanda kwe kukuuma embeera eno okutuuka mu mujiji oguddako.
What seems important is, many analysts of Rwanda will tell you that the society here has a strong tendency to buy into what its rulers tell it to do.	Ekiringa eky'omugaso kiri nti abatunuulizi b'ensonga mu Rwanda bajja kukugamba nti abatuuze wano balina enkola ennungi ey'okukkaanya n'ebyo abafuzi bye babagamba okukola.
Even though such cultural concept can be misleading, it may hold some water in this Central African nation.	Wadde nga ebintu byobuwangwa biwabya, kiyinza okuba n'omulamwa mu ggwanga lino eriri mu masekkati ga Afirika.
The effectiveness with which the state that Kagame over threw mobilised ordinary civilians to pick machetes.	Obwangu bwa gavumenti Kagame gye yaggyako okukunga abantu ba bulijjo okukwata ebyokulwanyisa.
Rwandan society has proved to have an unusual respect to power and if this history holds true, it can also work the other way.	Abantu ba Rwanda balabise nga bagondera abantu abali mu buyinza mu ngeri etali ya bulijjo era singa ekyafaayo kino kiba kituufu, kisobola n'okukola mu ngeri endala.
Therefore, as ordinary people cheer Kagame's insistence on a common Rwandan identity;	Nolwekyo, abantu aba bulijjo batendereza nnyo okubaawo kwa Kagame ku lw'okubaawo kw'omunnansi wa Rwanda owa bulijjo.
Is it a reflection of the success of Railway Protection Force's ideology?	Kiraga obuwanguzi bw'ekirowoozo kya Railway Protection Force?
However, it is not only Kagame who is surprising in this election.	Wabula Kagame yekka si yeyeewuunyisa mu kulonda kuno.
The interesting person is the candidate for the opposition Social Democratic Party.	Omuntu asingako amaanyi ye yeesimbyewo ku ludda oluvuganya olulwanirira eddembe lyabantu .

Ntawukuriryayo was in Rwanda in the early 1990s and belongs to the few moderates who did not participate in the racial killing.	Ntawukiriryayo yali mu Rwanda mu myaka gya lukumi mu lwenda era ali omu ku batono abateetaba mu kittabantu eky'amawanga.
"Manase Nshutu told me, being tall gave Ntawukuriryayo a ""tutsi look""."	Manase Nshutu yangambye, Ntawukiriryayo okubeera omuwanvu kyamufaananya Omutuusi.
It is possible this stereotyping gave Ntawukuriryayo an insight into the dangers of ethnic politics.	Kisoboka nti okunafuya abakyala kuno kwabaguliza Ntawukuriryayo ku buzibu byobufuzi bw'amawanga.
Ntawukuriryayo served as minister in the Kagame led federation government.	Ntawukirirwayo yaweerezaako nga minisita mu gavumenti ya Kagame ey'ekiseera.

According to Kamanzi, Personal and Social Development aims to identify key areas where it can make quick wins.	Okusinziira Ku Kamanzi, ekibiina ekifa ku nkulaakulana y'omuntu ssekinnoomu n' eyawamu kiruubirira okuzuula ebitundu gye kisobola okufuna amangu obuwanguzi.

This way, Request For Proposal has created such hopeless fear in Rwandans.	Mu ngeri eno, embeera eno etaddewo okutya n'obutaba na ssuubi mu Banyarwanda.

Yusuf Lule issued a statement from Nairobi and telexed to Uganda newspapers.	Yusuf Lule yafulumiza ekiwandiiko e Nairobi era ne kyeyolekera mu mpapula z'amawulire z'e Uganda.
According to political observers, the statement is a direct turn down to what Lule said.	Okusinzira batunuulizi b'ebyobufuzi, ekiwandiiko kino kyali kisambajja butereevu ebyo Lule bye yali ayogedde.

Most of the people in Northern Uganda are poor.	Abantu abasinga obungi mu bukiikakkono bwa Uganda baavu.
Michael Okia, the senior entomologist at Uganda's Ministry of Health, offers explanations why Apac bears such an over balanced malaria burden.	Michael Okia, Omukugu mu kwekkaaya ebiwuka mu minisitule y'ebyobulamu annyonnyola nti mu Apac waliyo omusujja gwa Malaria mungi.
Finally, Apac's hot temperatures allow malaria infected mosquitoes to reproduce quickly.	Ekisembayo, ebbugumu eringi mu Apac lye livaako ensiri ezisiiga Malaria okubiika n'okwalula amangu.
Okia says a second type of mosquito called anopheles funestus is also common around the Apac district swamps and bushes.	Okia agamba nti ekika ky'ensiri ekirala ekiyitibwa anopheles funestus nakyo kingi muntobazzi n'ebisiko by'omu Disitulikiti y'e Apac.
Since June 2005 when Uganda was considered for the President's Malaria Initiative, millions of dollars have been spent fighting the disease.	Okuva mu Gwomukaaga, 2005 Uganda lwe yaweebwa ssente okulwanyisa Malaria okuva mu ofiisi ya Pulezidenti, Obukadde bwa doolla busaasaanyiziddwa ku kulwanyisa endwadde eno.
Uganda completed Phase I of a sixty six million American dollars Global Fund Round Four grant that provided a mix of malaria drugs.	Uganda yamaliriza omutendera ogusooka ku Bukadde bwa ddoola za Amerika enkaaga mu omukaaga eziva mu Global Fund Round Four  abaasindika ebika by'eddagala lya malaria.
The Global Fund Round Four Phase II grant of 71 million dollars, signed in 2008 will provide enough supplies of American College Testings.	Ensimbi za Global Fund Round Phase II ez'obuwumbi bwa ddoola 71, ezaateekebwako omukono mu 2008 zijja kuyamba amatendekero ga America okufuna ebikozesebwa mu kukebera.
This will be done nationwide through 2011.	Kino kijja kukolebwa mu ggwanga lyonna mu 2011
In spite of this, Uganda still falls behind regional countries by fifty percent on the target to cut malaria infections.	Wadde nga kino weekiri, Uganda ekyali mabega ku mawanga g'omu kitundu n'ebitundu ataano ku kikumi ku kigendererwa ky'okumalawo omusujja gw'ensiri.
In 2006, the government endorsed the use of indoor residual spraying as a trial programme in ten districts, including Apac.	Mu 2006, gavumenti yayisa okufuuyira ebintu mu mayumba ng'enteekateeka y'okugezesezaako mu distulikiti kkumi omuli ne Apac
Indoor residual spraying was last used in 1963, and has so far made use of Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane, Icon, and Fendona.	Okufuuyira ebintu mu mayumba kwasemba kukozesebwa mu 1963, era nga bakyakozesa Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane, Icon ne Fendona.
Bendiocrab a chemical endorsed by the World Health Organisation, will soon be rolled out.	Eddagala lya Bendiocrab eryekebejjebwa ekitongole ky'ebyobulamu eky'ensi yonna lijja kutogozebwa amangu ddala..
Okia says, the use of different chemicals in spraying mosquitoes follows an insecticide management recess.	Okia agamba nti eddagala erikozesebwa okufuuyira ensiri ligoberera enkwatamu y'eddagala entuufu.
Okia explains that malaria parasites in the human body developed resistance to drugs such as chloroquine.	Okia annyonnyola nti obuwuka bw'omusujja gw'ensiri mu mubiri bwatandika okugaana eddagala nga kulolokwini.
Okia said that the use of different chemicals in the indoor residual spray is intended to prevent insects from getting used to one chemical.	Okia agamba nti okukozesa eddagala okufuuyira ebintu mu mayumba kiruubiriddwa okutangira ebiwuka kumanyiira ddagala erimu.
Dr Chris Baryomunsi says, although it sounds reasonable for mosquitoes to build up a resistance to chemicals, continual use is actually effective.	Dr. Chris Baryomunsi agamba nti wadde nga kiwulikika ng'ekyamagezi ensiri okugaana eddagala, okwongera okulikozesa kulungi.
Health experts think of switching chemical sprays because it has been observed that mosquitoes in Apac do not die.	Abakugu mu byobulamu balowooza ku ky'okukyusa eddagala kubanga kirabiddwa nti ensiri z'omu Apac tezifa.
This happens when they continuously use the same chemical spray.	Kino kituukawo nga bagenda mu maaso n'okukozesa eddagala lye limu erifuuyira.
Baryomunsi adds that a chemical like Icon is more expensive but relatively safer because it is less associated with environmental problems.	Baryomunsi ayongerako nti eddagala nga Icon lya buseereko naye ddungiko kubanga teririna nnyo buzibu na butonde.
Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane was used in Europe and several countries in Asia in quarter of the 20th century, where malaria is now history.	Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane yakozesebwa mu Europe ne mu mawanga ag'enjawulo mu Asia ng'ekyasa kya 20 kyakatandika, omusujja gw'ensiri kati byafaayo.
Indoor residual spraying using Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane was first used in Uganda between 1959 and 1963 in Kigezi.	Okufuuyira mu mayumba nga bakozesa Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane, kwasooka kukozesebwa mu Uganda wakati wa 1959 ne 1963 mu Kigezi.
This was during the malaria trial removal project.	Kino kyaliwo mu nteekateeka y'okumalawo omusujja gw'ensiri.
In fact, the first chemical to use in the Indoor residual spraying project in July 2006 was Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane.	Kituufu, eddagala eryasooka okozesebwa mu nteekateeka y'okufuuyira mu mayumba mu Gwomusanvu lyali lya Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane.
DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane has more than six months, which is the longest, per dosage	Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane alina emyezi egisukka omukaaga era nga ye ddoozi esingayo okuwangaala.
The effectiveness of Icon lasts between three and six months after spraying.	Okukola kwa Icon kumala wakati w'emyezi esatu n'omukaaga oluvannyuma lw'okufuuyira.
Ebong says government has to take a joint approach in the fight against malaria.	Ebong agamba gavumenti erina okukolera awamu okulwanyisa omusujja gw'ensiri.
He notes that emphasis on the use of treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying with DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane should take centre stage.	Agamba nti essira ku kukozesa obutimba bw'ensiri obulimu eddagala, okufuuyira mu mayumba ne Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane birina okwesigamwako.
He wonders why the distribution of bed nets began in central and western Uganda instead of Apac where the disease is widely spread.	Yeewuunya lwaki okugaba obutimba bw'ensiri kwatandikira mu masekkati ne mu bugwanjuba bwa Uganda mu kifo kya Apac ekirwadde gye kisaasaanye ennyo.
Ebong said that if government can drive out malaria in Apac as a pilot scheme, it can deal with malaria in the country.	Ebong agamba nti bwe kiba nga gavumenti esobola okumalawo omusujja gw'ensiri mu Apac ng'ekyokugezesezaako, esobola okulwanyisa omusujja gw'ensiri mu ggwanga.
In Apac each person is still bitten on average five times a day by an infective mosquito.	Mu Apac,  buli muntu akyalumwa ensiri ereeta omusujja ekitono ennyo emirundi etaano.
According to the Malaria Operation Plan 2010, there seven hundred thousand houses which will be sprayed in the six districts.	Okusinzira ku nteekateeka z'okumalawo omusujja gw'ensiri mu 2010, waliwo ennyumba emitwalo nsanvu ezijja okufuuyirwa mu distulikiti mukaaga.
The finding by researchers supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH;	Ebyazuulibwa abanoonyereza abayambibwako National Institute of Allergy and Infectious, ekitundu ku NIH.
Clarifies the picture of parasite metabolism.	Kitangaaza ekifaananyi engeri ekiwuka gye kibeerawo.
Manuel Llinas of Princeton University and colleagues discovered that the deadliest malaria parasite, uses a double branched metabolic pathway.	Manuel Linas owa ssettendekero ya Princeton ne banne baazuula ekiwuka ky'ensiri ekisinga okuba eky'obulabe ekikozesa enzira zombi okwebeezaawo.
According to Dr. Llinas, this specific branched pathway has not been detected previously in any other organism.	Okusinziira ku Musawo Linas, ekika kino kibadde tekizuulibwanga mu kintu kyonna.
The malaria parasite appears to use one branch primarily to generate the molecule acetyl Certificates of Analysis.	Akawuka k'ensiri kafaanana okukozesa ettabi limu okusooka okukola okwekaliriza kwa satifiketi ez'obuyungiro bwa acetyl
This branch may represent particularly weak points to target with antimalarial drugs, says Dr. Llinas.	Musawo Linas agamba nti ettabi lino lirabika okuba eryangu okujjanjabwa eddagala eriwonya omusujja gw'ensiri.
An estimated two point eighty five billion people world wide were at risk of contracting malaria in 2009.	Abantu abateeberezebwa okuba obuwumbi bubiri kinaana mu butaano okwetooloola ensi yonna baali mu katyabaga k'okukwatibwa omusujja gw'ensiri mu 2009.
Approximately ninety one percent of the world wide population is at risk of Malaria parasite lives in central and south east Asia.	Kumpi ebitundu kyenda mu kimu ku kikumi eby'abantu abali mu nsi bali mu katyabaga k'okufuna akawuka akaleeta omusujja gw'ensiri akali mu masekkati n'obukiikakkono bw'obuvanjuba bwa Asia.
Although the United Nations reports that malaria cases and/or deaths have dropped by half in twenty five countries in the past ten years.	Yadde ng'ekibiina ky'amawanga amagatte kiraga nti abantu abalina oba bafudde omusujja gw'ensiri bakendeddeko ekitundu mu nsi abiri mu ttaano mu myaka ekkumi egiyise.
European researchers have discovered that antibiotics could help fight malaria.	Abanonyereza Abazungu bazudde nti eddagala eritta obuwuka lisobola okuyamba mu kulwanyisa omusujja gw'ensiri.
A 2009 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the leading malaria drug was less effective against the disease.	Mu 2009, okunoonyereza okwafulumira mu New England Journal of Medicine kwateesa nti eddagala erisinga okukozesebwa ku musujja gw'ensiri terikola.
Pascal GahamanyiI in July/August 2010 issue of Foreign Policy Magazine explains how malaria causing parasites survive inside human blood cells.	Pascal Gahamanyil mu Gwomusanvu oba Ogwomunaana 2010 ensonga ya Magazine eya   Foreign Policy ennyonyola engeri ebiwuka ebireeta omusujja gw'ensiri gye bibeerawo munda mu butoffaali bw'omusaayi gw'omuntu.
Ayittey claimed that the Rwanda Patriotic Front dominates all levels of power.	Ayittey yagamba nti Rwanda Patriotic Front emaamidde emitendera gy'obukulembeze gyonna.
"His publication also included President Kagame what he calls the ""worst of the worst leaders""."	Ekiwandiiko kye era kyazingiramu Pulezidenti Paul Kagame gw'agamba nti y'akyasinze obubi mu bakulembeze bonna.
Reading the magazine, one wonders whether George Ayittey had any facts to support his shallow and foolish labeling of President Kagame.	Bw'osoma akatabo, omuntu yeewuunya oba George Ayittey yalina obukakafu bwonna okuwagira kalebule gw'ayogera ku Pulezidenti Kagame.
Since Railway Protection Force came to power in 1994, it has never attempted to take over political power.	Okuva Railway Protection Force lwe yajja mu buyinza mu 1994, tekigezangako kutwala buyinza.
Apart from including all tribal groups in the cabinet, Railway Protection Force also accommodated all political parties.	Ng'oggyeko okuteekamu amawanga gonna mu lukiiko lwa baminisita, Railway Protection Fore era esembeza ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi byonna.
These included the Social Democratic Party, Rwanda Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Union of the Rwandan People, DRM .	Bino mulimu Social Democratic party, Rwanda Socialist Party, Rwanda Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Union of the Rwandan People, DRM.
The Rwandan constitution of 2003 that marked the end of the transition is an inclusive one.	Ssemateeka wa Rwanda owa 2003 eyakomya enkyukakyuka naye mw'ali.
In addition to this, the President, Prime Minister, President of the Senate, Speaker of Parliament must come from different political parties.	Mu kwongera ku kino, Pulezidenti, Ssaabaminisita, Prezidenti wa Senate, Omukubiriza wa paalamenti alina okuva mu kibiina ky'ebyobufuzi eky'enjawulo.
Due to this provision, the Rwandan parliament today has the highest percentage of women parliamentarians in the whole world.	Mu kino, Paalamenti ya Rwanda leero y'esingamu omuwendo gw'abakyala omungi mu nsi yonna.
The security sector which was dominated by former Rwandan exiles due to historical factors has transformed over the years.	Ebyokwerinda ebyali bimaamiddwa Abanyalwanda abaali mu buwanganguse olw'ensonga z'ebyafaayo kizze kikyuka okumala akaseera.
The Rwanda Defence Force has discussed, retrained and absorbed officers and men from the former government forces.	Rwanda Defence Force ekubaganyizza ebirowoozo, ezzizzaawo n'okukuuma abakungu n'abasajja abaaliko mu magye ga gavumenti.
For example, over fifteen thousant armed forces of Rwanda have already been joined in Resource Description Framework.	Okugeza, abajaasi ba Rwanda abasukka mu mutwalo gumu n'ekitundu baamaze dda okuyingizibwa mu kitongole ekigaba emirimu.
In the Civil Service, the government has put in place various programmes, mechanisms, processes and institutions.	Mu mirimu gya gavumenti, gavumenti etaddewo pulogulaamu ez'enjawulo, eb'yokukanika n'amatendekero.
The Public Service Commission has been put in place to handle all recruitments into public offices.	Akakiiko akagaba emirimu kateereddwawo okukola ku kugaba emirimu gya woofiisi za gavumenti.
George Ayittey claims that the Rwandan Patriotic Front dominates the education sector as part of the civil service.	George Ayittey agamba nti Rwanadan Patriotic Front emaamidde ebyenjigiriza byonna ng'ekitundu ku mirimu gyabbwe.
Almost all of the five public universities in Rwanda are headed by foreigners.	Kumpi ssettendekero za gavumenti zonna mu Rwanda zikulirwa bagwira.
Most of the university lecturers in both public and private universities in Rwanda come from foreign countries.	Abasomesa abasinga mu zi ssettendekero za gavumnenti n'ezobwannannyini mu Rwanda baava mu mawanga magwira.
Ayittey also reported that those who challenge the president are accused of being isolating, hatemongers and are arrested.	Ayittey era yategeeza nti abo abavuganya Pulezidenti bagambibwa okubeera bokka, ab'ebiruyi era bakwatibwa.
The most pressing issue that government had to deal with upon assuming office in 1994 was to ensure the tribal killing does not take place again.	Ensonga eyali esinga okubeera enkulu gavumenti gye yalina okusooka okukolako ng'etuuse mu woofiisi mu 1994 kwe kulaba nti okuttingana kw'amawanga tekuddamu.
Avoiding the repeat of 1994 situation, the government of Rwanda decided to immediately deal with the issue of accountability.	Okwewala embeera ya 1994 okuddamu, gavumenti ya Rwanda yasalawo mangu okukola ku nsonga y'ensaasaanya.
This accountability was for tribal killing doers within the rule of law.	Obuvunaanyizibwa bwali ku abo abatta nga basinziira ku mawanga nga yeesigamiziddwa ku mateeka.
It is a fact that the isolating and deniers of the tutsi genocide exist mainly among Rwandans.	Kituufu nti okusosola n'abeegaana ekittabantu ky'Abatuusi gyekiri okusinga mu Banyalwanda.
Non Rwandans associated with the old tribal killing regimes.	Abatali Banyalwanda abalina akakwate ku kuttibwa kw'abantu mu mirembe egyayita.
This has been at the core of many African conflicts in the past ten years.	Eno yebadde ensibuko y'obukuubagano bw'Abafirika obungi mu myaka ekkumi egiyise.
In Rwanda, there are still some politicians who hope Rwandan Patriotic Front is one of the world's most all inclusive governments.	Mu Rwanda, era wakyaliyo bannabyabufuzi abasuubira nti Rwanda Patriotic Front y'emu ku gavumenti ezisinga okugatta abantu ab'endowooza ez'enjawulo.
The problem arises that analysts like George Ayittey mislead the world by focusing on isolated incidents and basing on the present.	Obuzibu bujja nti abatunuulizi b'ensonga nga Goerge Ayittey bawabya ensi ng'essira baliteeka ku bigwawo ebimu n'okusinziira ku biriwo.
This does not mean that Africa does not have good leaders.	Kino tekitegeeza nti Afirika terina bakulembeze balungi.
Africa has had some of the best leaders in the world; Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere, Nkwame Nkrumah and others.	Afirika ebaddeko n'abamu ku bakulembeze abasinga obulungi mu nsi yonna nga Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere, Nkwame Nkrumah n'abalala.
President Kagame should be seen in that light, a leader with a big vision for both Rwanda and the continent.	Pulezidenti Kagame alina kulabibwa mu kifaananyi ekyo, omukulembeze alina ekiruubiriwa ekinene ekya Rwanda ne ssemazinga yenna.
Saying that attacks of President Kagame are always accused of dividing peope is thus ill intentioned or uninformed.	Okugamba nti obulumbaganyi bwa Pulezidenti Kagame bulijjo bubeera ku kwawula mu bantu kiba tekirina kye kigenderera oba nga tebalina kye bamanyi.
Before long, Mwenda, Kanaabi and approximately forty other individuals that have been charged with sedition, were free.	Ng'akaseera tekannayita, Mwenda, Kanaabi n'abantu abaali bateeberezebwa okuba ana abaali baavunaanibwa ogw'okukuma omuliro mu bantu, baateebwa.
Andrew Mwenda's sedition saga originated on Wednesday August 10, 2005.	Akajagalalo ka Andrew Mwenda okukuma mu bantu omuliro kaatandika 10 Ogwomunaana, 2005.
His death was a huge blow to the peace agreement that had been signed three weeks earlier.	Okufa kwe lyali kkonda ddene mu ndagaano y'emirembe eyali yaakateekebwako omukono wiiki ssatu emabega.
Three days of riots in Sudan followed and left over one hundred thirty people dead.	Ennaku ssatu ez'obwegugungo mu Sudan bwaddirira era ne buleka abantu abasoba mu kikumi asatu nga bafu.
Accusing fingers were pointed at President Museveni who had lent the sixty year old leader his own personal helicopter.	Ennwe zaasongebwa mu Pulezidenti Museveni eyali ayazise omukulembeze ow'emyaka enkaaga egy'obukulu ennyonyi eya nnamunkanga ey'obuntu.
In Uganda, the most vocal accusations against Museveni came from Andrew Mwenda.	Mu Uganda, omuntu asinga okwogera ng'avunaana Museveni ye Andrew Mwenda.
"Mwenda felt that Uganda should be held accountable for putting Garang on ""a junk helicopter"" at night over a rebel infested territory."	Mwenda awulira nga Uganda erina okuvunaanibwa kuteeka Garanga ku nnyonyi ya nnamunkanga ekiro okuyita mu kifo ekijjuddemu abatujju.
These comments, together with his role in the subsequent publication of High Command minutes, induced Museveni to lash out at Uganda's press.	Ebyogerebwa binno, wamu n'obuvunaanyizibwa bwe nga ow'okuntiko okufulumya ebibadde mu lukiiko, byaletera Museveni okunyiigira bannamawulire.
"""I have been seeing this young boy, Mwenda, writing about Rwanda, writing about Sudan and writing about the Uganda People's Defence Forces""."	Mbaddenga ndaba omulenzi ono, Mwenda ng'awandiika ku Rwanda, Sudan ne Uganda People's Defence Forces.
Mwenda and Eastern Africa Media Institute lawyer, Kenneth Kakuru, shared a laugh.	Mwenda ne munnamateeka wa Eastern Africa Media Institute Kenneth Kakuru baasekamu.
His threats are completely ignored since President Mobutu Seko ruled Congo for thirty two years and Museveni has yet to clock twenty.	Okutiisatiisa kwe tekwafibwako ddala kuba Pulezidenti Mobutu Seko yafugira Congo emyaka asatu mu ebiri ate Museveni tannaweza myaka abiri.
How did he die and how did he leave Congo yet his own soldiers were shooting at him?	Yafa atya era yava atya mu Congo ng'abajaasibe bennyini baali bamukuba amasasi?
If Museveni wants to walk that path, I tell you he's welcome to walk that path.	Museveni bw'aba ayagala kuyita mu kubbo eryo, tumwanirizza.
The episode, which Mwenda has since acknowledged went extremely overboard, provoking the Ugandan government to shut KFM.	Akatundu Mwenda ke yakkiriza kaagendera ddala wala nga kasosonkereza gavumenti ya Uganda okuggala KFM
However, this was not the first time the state had taken the outspoken Mwenda to court.	Newankubadde, guno si gwe gwali omulundi ogusooka gavumenti okutwala Mwenda ateerya ntama mu kkooti.
Mwenda and Charles Onyango Obbo, who were the Monitor's senior reporter and editor, respectively at that time, were charged.	Mwenda ne Charles Onyango Obbo abaali abasasi era abasunsuzi b'amawulire abakugu mu budde obwo, baavunaanibwa.
The two journalists challenged the charge in the Constitutional Court, but were told to face the charges in a lower court first.	Bannamawulire ababiri baawakanya omusango mu kkooti ya ssemateeka, naye baagambibwa okusooka okuvunaanibwa mu kkooti eya wansi.
Between October 24, 1998 and February 16, 1999, the pair made thirty three trips to the courts.	Wakati w'Ogweggumi nga 24, 1998 ne nga 16 Ogwokubiri 1999, ababiri bano baagenda emirundi asatu mu esatu mu kkooti.
When they took their petition back to the Constitutional Court, it upheld the legality of the offence with which they had been charged.	Bwe batwala okujulira kwabwe ku kkooti ya ssemateeka, tekwalimu bikwata ku musango ogwali gubavunaanibwa.
However, the court's decision was later appealed in the Supreme Court, and the publication of false news law was ruled unconstitutional.	Newankubadde, okusalawo kwa kkooti kwajulirwa mu kkooti ensukulumu era etteeka ly'okufulumya amawulire amafu neriwangula ewali bukwakulizo.
Up until the Constitutional Court's landmark ruling on August 25 this year, sedition has been used against politicians.	Okutuusa kkooti ya ssemateeka bwe yakola okutuusa mu Ogwomunaana nga 25 omwaka guno, okukuma mu bantu omuliro kubadde kukozesebwa ku bannabyabufuzi.
To date, only Haruna Kanaabi, the former reporter and editor of the now defunct Shariat news paper has served a jail term for a sedition charge.	Okutuuka kati, Haruna Kanaabi yekka, eyali omusasi era omusunsuzi w'olupapula lw'amawulire olwa Shariat olutakyakola abadde yasibwa mu kkomera olw'okukuma omuliro mu bantu.
"When Mwenda was charged in the aftermath of the ""Garang Episode"" in 2005, he joined the East African Media Institute."	Mwenda bwe yavunaanibwa olw'akatambi ka Garang mu 2005, yeegatta ku East African Media Institute.
"""At one point, a judge would be indisposed and another time the state counsel was sick,"" says James Nangwala of the delay."	James Nangwala agamba nti, olumu omulamuzi yalinga si mwetegefu ate nga ebiseera ebirala nga saabawolereza wa gavumenti mulwadde.
All along, however, the government continued to pluck journalists from their office, bring them to the Central Police Station for questioning.	Awo wonna, newankubade, gavumenti yagenda mu maaso n'okuggya bannamawulire mu woofisi zaabwe ng'ebatwala ku kitebe kya poliisi ekikulu okubabuuza.
"""I've been to the police station over fifty times during my nine years of journalism,"" recalls Semuju Ibrahim, former editor at The Observer."	Eyaliko omusunsuzi mu The Observer Semuju Ibrahim ajjukira nti yali ku poliisi emirundi egisukka mu ataano mu myaka omwenda gye yamala mu mawulire.
Museveni's government, having prosecuted one sedition suspect successfully in the past 24 years, cannot expect to win many of their cases.	Gavumenti ya Museveni, oly'okubeera ng'esobodde okuwaaba omusango gw'abateeberezebwa okukuma omuiliro mu bantu gumu mu myaka 24 egiyise, tesuubira ku bawangula misango mirala.
"""I've lost friends on account of my charge,"" says former Independent and current Daily Monitor reporter, John Njoroge."	John Njoroge eyali omusasi wa Independent era nga kati akola ne Daily Monitor agamba nti aviiriddwako mikwano gye olw'emisango gye.
"Moreover, Makerere University Mass Communication lecturer Adolf Mbaine says many students are now seeking ""safer"" careers in public relations."	Kyokka, omusomesa wa bannamawulire ku ssettendekero ya Makerere Adolf Mbaine agamba nti abayizi bangi kati banoonya mirimu gitali gya bulabe nga bakolagana n'abantu.
"""This section of the law was limiting Ugandans from demanding accountability from their leader,"" says Kanaabi."	Kanaaba agamba nti ekitundu ky'etteeka lino kyali kikugira Bannayuganda okubanja ensaasaana okuva eri abakulembeze baabwe.
Subsequent to the Constitutional Court's ruling, State Attorney Patricia Mutesi, said the state will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.	Okwefaanaanyirizaako ensala ya kkooti ya ssemateeka, ssaabawolereza wa gavumenti Patricia Mutesi yagamba nti gavumenti ejja kujulira ku nsala mu kkooti ensukkulumu.
Mutesi has the support of powerful figures in the government such as Minister of State for Ethics and Integrity James Nsaba Buturo.	Mutebi alina obuwagizi bw'abantu ab'amaanyi mu gavumenti nga minisita omubeezi ow'empisa n'obuntubulamu James Nsaba Buturo.
"""It is an essential piece of legislation,"" Minister Buturo told The Independent by phone."	Minisita Buturo yagambye aba Independent ku ssimu nti kintu kikulu nnyo mu mateeka.
Buturo added that in most developed countries, the media is mature but, you don't find that here.	Buturo yayongerako nti mu nsi ezaakulaakulana amawulire kikulu naye wano tokisangawo.
It is fortunate for Minister Buturo and other members of the government displeased with the sedition ruling.	Kya mukisa eri minisita Buturo n'abali mu gavumenti abalala abatasanyukira nsala ya kkooti ku kukuma muliro mu bantu.
"""They wanted the Supreme Court to deal with it,"" Mwenda reasoned confidently afterward."	Mwenda oluvannyuma yayogedde n'obuvumu nti baali baagala kkooti ensukkulumu ekikoleko.
In the Independent of September 03 - 09, 2010, they were sure we were going to appeal.	Mu Independent w'omu Gwomwenda 03 okutuusa nga 09, 2010, baali bakakasa nti tugenda kujulira.
Nangwala and Kenneth Kakuru, counsel for the Eastern Africa Media Institute appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.	Nangwala ne Kenneth Kakuru abawolereza ba Eastern Africa Media Institute baajulira ku nsala mu kkooti ensukkulumu.
"The promoting sectarianism charge, ""offers the government with less leg room,"" says Mwenda."	Mwenda agamba nti okusosola mu bantu kiwadde gavumenti ebbeetu ttono.
However, these charges may appear insignificant.	Newankubadde, emisango gino girinza okulabika ng'egitalina makulu.
If the proposed amendments to the Press and Journalist Act 1995 are submitted and passed by parliament.	Singa enkyukakyuka ezitegekeddwa mu tteeka ly'amawulire erya 1995 ziweebwayo era ne ziyisibwa paalamenti.
Those amendments, would require publications to be licensed yearly by the Media Council and charged with enforcing ethical standards.	Enkyukakyuka ezo, zijja kwetaaga okufulumizibwa Media Council mu mawulirile era ziweebwe olukusa buli mwaka era zibeeko amateeka agaziteekebwako.
Under the Press and Journalist Amendment Bill 2010, any publication could have their licence revoked if it publishes injurious material.	Wansi w'etteeka erifuga bannamawulire erya 2010, omukutu gw'amawulire gusobola okuggyibwako layisinsi singa gufulumwa amawulire amakyamu.
The Media Council would also be given authority to not only mediate but regulate any potential media violations.	Media Council yandiweeredwa obuyinza obutakoma ku kukwanaganya bukwanaganya wabula n'okuwera yenna avvoola amawulire.
Joshua Kyalimpa, President of UJA and member of Article 29 Coalition, says the group has met with the Minister of Information.	Joshua Kyalimpa, Pulezidenti wa UJA era mmemba akkaanya n'akawaayiiro 29, agamba nti ekibiina kirina okusisinkana minisita w'ebyempuliziganya.
Even Media Council Chairperson, Professor Goretti Nassanga, has expressed skepticism over the amendments in their current form.	Ne ssentebe wa Media Council, Pulofeesa Goretti Nassanga, yalaze okubuusabusa ku nkola eriwo.
"""I'm hoping that is not how the bill will turn out,"" says Professor Goretti."	Pulofeesa Gorretti agamba nti asuubira nti ebbago terijja kuvaamu ekyo kisuubirwa.
Professor Goretti Nassanga went on to talk about the bill.	Pulofeesa Goretti Nassanga yageenze mu maaso n'okwogera ku bbago.
"Professor Nassanga added that the balance between media laws that promote national unity, ""is still very touchy""."	Pulofeesa Nassanga yayongeddeko nti omwenkanonkano wakati w'amateeka g'amawulire agatumbula obumu mu ggwanga tegakyakwatibwako.
The Independent of September 03 - 09, 2010 reported about the Andrew Mwenda and Eastern Africa Media Institute sedition victory.	Independenti w'omu Gwomwenda nga 03 okutuuka nga 09, 2010 yawandiika ku Andrew Mwenda ne Eastern Africa Media Institute ku kuwangula omusango gw'okukuma omuliro mu bantu.
"""I was able to stay with ordinary prisoners and see the challenge of the prison system in Uganda""."	Nasobola okubeera n'abasibe aba bulijjo ne ndaba okusoomoozebwa kw'amakomera mu Uganda.
"""The police were very nice to me, the president's son came to see me"", Mwenda continued."	Mwenda yayongedeko nti abapoliisi baali balungi gyali, mutabani wa pulezidenti yajja okumulaba.
Kanaabi is the acting executive secretary for Independent Media Council and the only Ugandan journalist ever convicted of sedition.	Kanaabi ye muwandiisi w'olukiiko lwa Media Council olw'etengeredde era nga ye munnamawulire wa Uganda yekka eyaakasingisibwa omusango gw'okukuma omuliro mu abantu.
Haruna Kanaabi has been charged with sedition on two occasions.	Haruna Kanaabi avunaaniddwa olw'okukuma omuliro mu abantu emirundi ebiri.
The first, in 1993, occurred after the Shariat newspaper mocked several ministers from trying to get support for Museveni.	Ogwasooka, mu 1993, gwaliwo oluvannyuma lw'eggulire lya Shariat okusosonkereza baminisita abawera obutafuna buganzi okuva owa Museveni.
The opinion argued the ministers would have been better served sharing their encouraging words with Museveni's cows.	Ekiteeso ky'alaga nti baminisita bandikoze bulungi singa bagabananga ebigambo byabwe ebizzaamu amaanyi n'ente za Museveni.
Kanaabi, who was subeditor of the paper, says he was only responsible for the article's headline.	Kanaabi eyali omusunsuzi w'olupapula, agamba nti ye yali avunaanyizibwa buvunanyizibwa ku mutwe gw'eggulire gwokka.
The second occasion took place in 1996 after Museveni had toured Western Uganda and parts of Rwanda.	Omulundi ogwokubiri gwaliwo mu 1996 oluvannyuma lwa Museveni okulambula Obugwanjuba bwa Uganda n'ebitundu bya Rwanda.
Museveni was quoted in the nation assuring the people of Rwanda that he was there to write a new history.	Museveni yawulirwa mu ggwanga ng'akakasa abantu b'e Rwanda nti yaliwo kuwandiika byafaayo bipya.
Kanaabi recalls that he spoke as if he was the president of Rwanda.	Kanaabi ajjukira nti yayogera nga alinga nti ye Pulezidenti wa Rwanda.
As a result, Shariat ran an opinion that mocked Museveni for turning Rwanda into Uganda's fourtieth district.	Ekyavaamu, Shariat yaleeta ekirowoozo ekyasikiriza Museveni okufuula Rwanda disitulikiti ya Uganda ey'ana.
The same afternoon that the story came out, Kanaabi was arrested on charges of disobedience for a second time.	Mu ttuntu lye limu emboozi yafuluma nti Kanaabi yali akwatiddwa ku misango gy'okugyema omulundi ogwokubiri.
Kanaabi as he was represented the original question says that Mwenda never went to jail.	Kanaabi bwe yaleetebwa, okwebuuza kuli nti Mwenda teyagenda mu kkomera.
Luzira is a very different place.	Luzira kifo kya njawulo nnyo.
Kanaabi explained that there were no visitors in Luzira.	Kanaabi yannyonnyola nti e Luzira tewaaliyo bagenyi.
Kanaabi and others remained behind bars except from 8am to noon.	Kanaabi ne banne baasigala mu kaduukulu okuggyako okuva ku ssaawa bbiri ezookumakya okutuuka mu ttuntu.
The cell that would house Kanaabi and seventy to eighty other prisoners would be closed permanently for the night by 3pm everyday.	Akaduukulu Kanaabi mwe yandibadde ne basibe banne abalala nsanvu mu munaana kaggalwanga ekiro okuva ssaawa mwenda buli lunaku.
Kanaabi recalls that a man once collapsed from a heart condition and they still refused to open the cell.	Kanaabi ajjukira nti omusajja olumu yazirikako olw'embeera y'omutima naye era ne bagaana okuggulawo akaduukulu.
Kanaabi says that at Luzira, the food is simply posho and beans and is served only once daily.	Kanaabi agamba nti e Luzira, emmere yaayo kawunga na bijanjaalo ate egabibwa omulundi gumu gwokka olunaku.
But the hardest part for Kanaabi was the communal showers.	Naye ekyasinga okukaluubiriza ennyo Kanaabi bye binaabiro by'olukale.
As a result, Kanaabi would resort to washing himself with a jerry can over the toilet in his cell.	Ekyava mu kino, Kanaabi yasalangawo okunaabisa akaddomola mu kabuyonjo y'omu kaduukulu ke.
Kanaabi remained in Luzira for the duration of his four month trial.	Kanaabi yasigala e Luzira okumala emyezi gye ena ng'anoonyerezebwako.
Although Kanaabi was found guilty of disobedience at the end of his trial, he was released by the officer in charge of the prison shortly afterward.	Newankubadde nga Kanaabi yasingisibwa omusango gw'obujeemu oluvannyuma lw'okunoonyerezebwako, yateebwa omukulu akulira ekkomera nga waakayita akaseera katono.
Kanaabi's and Shariat's problems continued on the outside.	Ebizibu bya Kanaabi ne Shariat byeyongera nga bavuddeyo.
Harassment and intimidation of reporters and Shariat vendors persisted.	Okutulugunyizibwa n'okutiisibwatiisibwa kwa bannamawulire ne ba Shariat Vendors kweyongera.
The August 25 decision was a huge victory for Kanaabi and his colleagues but it still can't erase what has been stripped from him.	Nga 25 Ogwomunaana, okusalawo bwali buwanguzi bunene eri Kanaabi ne banne naye era  kizibu okuzzaawo ebimuggyiddwako.
At the end of the interview, Kanaabi reflects back at the suffering he went through.	Ku nkomerero ya yintaaviyu, Kanaabi ajjukira okubonaabona kwe yayitamu.
Haruna Kanaabi still reflects back at the suffering he went through while he was behind bars.	Haruna Kanaabi akyajjukira okubonaabona kwe yayitamu nga ali mabega wa mitayimbwa.
Seven years after the ruling National Resistance Movement was registered as a political party.	Emyaka musanvu okuva ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza ekya National Resistance Movement lwe kyawandiisibwa ng'ekibiina ky'ebyobufuzi.
Ofwono Opondo's insistence that NRM has an annual budget is promptly rejected by the admission of another senior party official.	Ofwono Opondo alemerako nti NRM erina embalirira y'omwaka eyagaanibwa oluvannyuma lw'okujja kw'omukungu w'ekibiina omulala.
Captain Mike Mukula says that they don't have that budget and he has never had a budget for his activities, not even a shilling.	Kaputeeni Mike Mukula agamba nti tebalina mbalirira eyo era tabangako na mbalirira ya mirimu gye, wadde ne siringi.
His defence is verified by another member of the National Executive Council, who declined to be named.	Obukuumi bwe bukakasibwa mmemba munne ow'olukiiko olufuzi eyagaanye okwasanguzibwa.
Other political parties like the DP, UPC and FDC have annual budgets, which they recently passed.	Ebibiina eby'obufuzi ebirala nga DP, UPC ne FDC birina embalirira z'omwaka ze byakayisa gye buvuddeko.
The UPC treasurer Peter Mukidi Walubiri says the party has a thirty three billion shillings budget for 2010/2011 ending next June.	Omuwanika wa UPC Peter Mukidi Walubiri agamba nti ekibiina kirina siringi obuwumbi asatu mu busatu obw'embalirira ya 2010/2011 ekoma Ogwomukaaga ogujja.
The FDC Spokesperson Wafula Oguttu says the party's national conference passed a twenty three billion shillings budget in February this year.	Omwogezi wa FDC Wafula Oguttu agamba nti olukiiko ttabamiruka lwayisa embalirira ya siringi obuwumbi abiri mu busatu mu Gwokubiri gw'omwaka guno.
The Democratic Party treasurer Issa Kikungwe too says his party's National Executive Committee recently passed a budget.	Omuwanika wa DP Issa Kikungwe naye agamba nti akakiiko k'ekibiina kye akoku ntikko kaayisa embalirira gye buvuddeko.
It's the National Resistance Movement, Uganda's biggest political party, which does not have a budget among the top four political parties.	National Resistance Movement, ky'ekibiina ky'ebyobufuzi ekisinga obunene mu Uganda ekitalina mbalirira mu bibiina ebina ebisinga obunene.
Neither is it officially funded by the government like in the case in Tanzania and South Africa where parties have business subsidiaries.	Tekivujjirirwa gavumenti nga bwe kiri mu Tanzania ne South Africa ebibiina gye birina bizinensi mwe biggya ssente.
"Except for the mid 1990s when NRM, previously called the ""Movement system"", set up Danze Enterprises Ltd as its trading arm."	Okuggyako mu masekkati ga 1990 NRM bwe yali eyitibwa omugendo bwe yatandikawo Danze Enterprises Ltd n'ettabi lyayo ery'obusuubuzi.
Nathan Igeme Nabeta says that each of the NRM's members contributes one hundred thousand shillings to the party every month.	Nathan Igeme Nabeta agamba nti buli mmemba wa NRM awaayo emitwalo kkumi eri ekibiina buli mwezi.
It cannot even finance one National Resistance Movement national conference in a year.	Tezisobola wadde okusasulira olukiiko ttabamiruka olwa National Resistance Movement mu mwaka.
For instance the National Resistance Movement spent four million shillings.	Okugeza National Resistance Movement yasaasaanya siringi obukadde buna.
NRM spent five billion shillings on allowances and transport of the thirty thousand delegates for the June 25 to June 27 conference this year.	NRM yasaasaanya siringi obuwumbi butaano ku nsako n'ebyentambula y'abakiise enkumi ssatu mu lukugaana olwa nga 25 Ogwomukaaga okutuuka nga 27 Ogwomukaaga omwaka guno.
That's why, observers say, more than half of the NRM executive are either cabinet ministers or hold other big government jobs.	Eyo y'ensonga lwaki, abalabi bagamba, ettundutundu ly'abali ku kakiiko ka NRM ako ku ntikko baminisita oba balina emirimu emirala eminene mu gavumenti.
NRMVice President, Proscovia Salaamu Musumba too says the National Resistance Movement's biggest financier is government.	Amyuka Pulezidenti wa NRM, Proscovia Salaamu Musumba naye agamba nti omuvujjirizi wa National Resistance Movement asinga ye gavumenti.
She says that those are the resources which are used to run the National Resistance Movement.	Agamba nti ezo ssente zeeyambisibwa okuddukanya National Resistance Movement.
This insistence is reinforced by Godber Tumushabe, Executive Director of the Advocates union for Development and Environment.	Okulemerako kuno kukubirizibwa Godber Tumushabe, ssenkulu wa Advocates Union for Development and Environment
Tumushabe says that it is not possible to separate the National Resistance Movement as a party from the government.	Tumushabe agamba nti tekisoboka kwawula National Resistance Movement ng'ekibiina ku gavumenti.
He says that the National Resistance Movement and its team are maintained through a carefully dodged funding system.	Agamba nti National Resistance Movement n'abantu baayo bakuumibwa mu kuvujjirirwa ensimbi ezibadde ez'okukola emirimu emirala.
Seven percent of the 2010/11 budget has been allocated to the public administration sector, defence and security.	Ebitundu musanvu ku kikumi eby'embalirira ya 2010/11 bigenda ku mirimu egigasa abantu ebyokwerinda awamu n'obukuumi.
For that reason, he says, it is not possible for the National Resistance Movement to be dominated by people who do not hold government jobs.	Ku lw'ensonga eyo, agamba nti, tekisoboka National Resistance Movement okujjulamu abantu abatalina mirimu mu gavumenti.
For instance, without considering the President, more than half of the NRM's 22 Central Executive Committee officials are cabinet ministers.	Okugeza, ng'oggyeko Pulezidenti, okusinga ekitundu ky'abakungu ba NRM 22 abali ku kakiiko k'oku ntikko baminisita.
The NRM National Chairman is President Yoweri Museveni and the 2nd National Vice Chairperson is Deputy Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga.	Ssentebe wa NRM ow'oku ntikko Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni n'amyuka ssentebe we owookubiri y'amyuka omwogezi wa paalamenti Rebecca Kadaga.
The Secretary General is Security Minister Amama Mbabazi and his Deputy Dorothy Hyuha is Minister without Portfolio.	Ssaabawandiisi ye minisita w'ebyokwerinda Amama Mbabazi ate omumyuka we Dorothy Hyuha ye minisita atalina mulimu gwa nkalakkalira.
The Chairperson of the National Resistance Movement Women's League is Education Minister Namirembe Bitamazire.	Ssentebe w'ekibiina ky'abakyala mu National Resistance Movement ye minisita w'ebyenjigiriza Namirembe Bitamazire.
The chairman of the youth league is Abbas Agaba, a State House employee.	Ssentebe w'ekisinde ky'abavubuka ye Abbas Agaba, omukozi mu maka g'obwapulezidenti.
The regional vice chairpersons general is only the first National Vice Chairman, Haji Moses Kigongo.	Abamyuka bassentebe b'ebitundu be bokka abamyuka ssentebe w'akakiiko, Haji Moses Kigongo.
The captain is Moses Ali from the north.	Kaputeeni ye Moses Ali okuva mu bukiikakkono.
Mike Mukula, Felistus Magomu, Treasurer Ndawula Kaweesi and his Deputy Katongole Singh do not hold cabinet jobs or senior government offices.	Mike Mukula, Felistus Magomu, omuwanika Ndawula Kaweesi n'omumyuka we Katongole Singh tebalina mirimu gya bwa minisita oba woofiisi za gavumenti enkulu.
It is important to note that by October 2005 Muhwezi and Mukula were in cabinet when the NRM Central Executive Committee was elected.	Kya makulu okumanya nti nga 25 Ogwekkumi Muhwezi ne Mukula baali baminisita, olukiiko lwa NRM olw'oku ntikko we lwalondebwa.
Muhwezi was the Minister for Health while Mukula was his deputy.	Muhwezi ye yali minisita w'ebyobulamu nga Mukula ye yali omumyuka we.
But even members of the Central Executive Committee who don't hold government jobs are beneficiaries of huge government subsidies.	Naye era bammemba b'akakiiko ak'oku ntikko abatalina mirimu gya gavumenti baganyulwa nnyo mu bintu bya gavumenti.
Hassan Basajjabalaba, has been a beneficiary of twenty one billion shillings soft loan from Bank of Uganda.	Hassan Basajjabalaba, aganyuddwa mu looni y'obuwumbi abiri mu kamu okuva mu bbanka ya Uganda enkulu.
NRM offices whose heads luck profitable government offices are either dormant or in virtual limbo due to financial constraints.	Woofiisi za NRM ng'abazikulira tebalina mirimu gya gavumenti gifuna nnyo kiri nti tebafaayo oba nga balina obuzibu bw'ebyensimbi.
They have not held a single meeting since they were formed in October 2005.	Tezituuzangayo lukiiko lwonna okuva lwe zaatandikibwawo mu Gwekkumi nga 2005.
Major General Muhwezi, the Chairman of the Veterans League says that all the leagues have not held any meetings.	Mmeeja genero Muhwezi, ssentebe w'abaazirwanako agamba nti ebiwayi byonna tebinnatuuza nkugaana zonna.
In a report to the National Executive Committee meeting of 12th January 2010, Mbabazi pointed out poor party.	Mu alipoota y'olukungaana lw'akakiiko ak'oku ntikko eya nga 12 Ogusooka 2010, Mbabazi yayogera ku kibiina ekyavu.
Muhwezi said the Members of Parliament contributions are used for rent and facilitation of party branch offices countrywide.	Muhwezi yagamba nti ssente eziweebwayo ababaka ba Paalamenti zikozesebwa okupangisa n'okuvujjirira woofiisi z'amatabi g'ekibiina okwetooloola eggwanga lyonna.
He mentioned the case of Rukungiri branch, which has gone for months without pay.	Yanokolayo ettabi ly'e Rukungiri, erimaze emyezi nga terisasula.
However, Muhwezi blames this problem on disorganisation within the party.	Wabula, Muhwezi ekizibu kino akiteeka ku bintu ebitatambula bulungi mu kibiina.
Dr Frank Nabwiso, says that the National Resistance Movement has over the years built a network through which it draws money.	Musawo Frank Nabwiso, agamba nti National Resistance Movement emyaka gyonna ebadde ezimba enkolagana mw'eggya ensimbi.
When the Independent pressed him, he became hostile saying the law allows the NRM to protect the identity of its funders.	Independent bwe yamubuuza ennyo, yava mu mbeera ng'agamba nti etteeka likkiriza NRM obutayasanguza bavujjirizi baakyo.
Opondo did not mention a contrary law that allows protection of sources of funding for a political party.	Opondo teyayogera tteeka likontana erikkiriza obutayasanguza makubo agavujjirira ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi.
Nabudere reminded the people that a new voters' register will be prepared next month.	Nabundere yajjukiza abantu nti enkalala z'abalonzi empaya zijja kuba zimaliriziddwa omwezi ogujja.
He thanked the people of Jinja and Iganga for their efforts in arresting vehicles, which smuggle Uganda coffee.	Yasiima abantu b'e Jinja ne Iganga olwa kaweefube gwe baateekamu okukwata ebidduka ebikukusa emmwanyi za Uganda.

The Federation for Democratic Change along with the Inter Party Cooperation parties seem confident.	Federation for Democratic Change wamu n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi balabika nga bamativu.
The argument of the opposition about the Electoral Commission is a means to an end.	Ebyogerwa ab'oludda oluvuganya ku kakiiko k'ebyokulonda bya kubayamba okufuna bye beetaaga.
Otunnu argues, the main cause of the UPC splits from the Inter Party Cooperation, is that President Museveni cannot be defeated.	Otunnu agamba, nti ensonga ekulu ereetedde UPC okuva mu mukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi, Museveni tasobola kuwangulwa.
The Democratic Party, now the Uganda People's Congress suggest that the opposition response in the lead up to the elections may be unlucky.	Democratic Party, kati Uganda People's Congress egamba enteekateeka z'oludda oluvuganya okugenda mu kalulu ziyinza obutaba na mukisa.
The beating of peaceful protesters over this period has undoubtedly tarnished the National Resistance Movement's reputation.	Okukuba kw'abeekalakaasi mu mirembe mu kiseera kino tekibuusibwabuusibwa nti kyayonoona ekifaananyi kya National Resistance Movement.
There are multitude of reports and public statements that express fear of violence in preparation for the polls in 2011.	Waliwo alipoota nnyigi n'ebyogerwa abantu ebiraga okutya obutabanguko mu kwetegekera okulonda kwa 2011.
Human rights activists Samuel Olara says five years is a long time in politics.	Omulwanirizi w'eddembe ly'obuntu Samuel Olara agamba nti emyaka etaano kiseera kinene mu byobufuzi.
When conditions are good, participation in Uganda's politics is the right thing to do.	Embeera bw'eba nga nnungi, okwenyigira mu byobufuzi bya Uganda kye kintu ekituufu okukola.

There are ongoing efforts by the state and President Kagame to intimidate the citizens into total silence.	Waliwo kaweefube agenda mu maaso wakati wa gavumenti ne Pulezidenti Kagame okutiisatiisa bannansi obutabaako kye boogera.
In my 10 years of association with Rwanda, I have encountered many people who are reluctant to talk about politics.	Mu myaka gyange 10 nga nkwatagana ne Rwanda, nsisinkanye abantu bangi abateefiirayo kwogera ku byobufuzi.
They include members and supporters of the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front, former members and members of the armed forces.	Bano mulimu bammemba n'abawagizi b'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza ekya Rwanda Patriotic Front, abaaliko mu magye n'abali mu magye.
I have also met people, including President Kagame, who is open and willing to discuss any subject.	Era nsisinkanye abantu omuli Pulezidenti Kagame, omwerufu era omwetegefu okukubaganya ebirowoozo ku nsonga yonna.
Many are members and supporters of the Rwanda Patriotic Front including public officials serving in a wide range of institutions.	Bammemba bangi era abawagizi ba Rwanda Patriotic Front omuli n'abakungu ba gavumenti mu bitongole eby'enjawulo.
Rwandan government critics, some of whom have never been there or read anything about genocide never ask themselves this question.	Abakolokota Gavumenti y'e Rwanda abamu ku bbo tebabeerangayo oba okusoma ku kintu kyonna ekikwata ku kittabantu tebeebuuzangako kibuuzo kino.
I have attended several public meetings where, before President Kagame speaks, people are given an opportunity to present their views on issues.	Neetabye mu nkungaana z'eggwanga eziwera gye ndabidde nga pulezidenti Kagame bw'aba tanayogera, abantu baweebwa omukisa okuwa ebirowoozo byabwe ku nsonga.
The government of Rwanda also hosts an Annual National Dialogue attended by people from all walks of life.	Gavumenti y'e Rwanda era etegeka olukungana lw'okukubaganya ebirowoozo olwa buli mwaka olwetabwamu abantu ab'engeri ez'enjawulo.
"The ""climate of fear"" claims have been used by some to explain large crowds during President Kagame's campaigns and on election day."	Embeera y'okutya egambibwa okuba nga ekozeseddwa abamu okunyonyola abantu abangi mu kampeyini za pulezidenti Kagame ne ku lunaku lw'okulonda.
It seems the objective was to portray Rwandans as incapable of deciding on whether to attend election rallies or even vote.	Kirabika ekigendererwa kyali kya kulanga Abanyalwanda nga abatasobola kusalawo oba beetaba mu nkungaana kunoonya obululu oba n'okulonda.
However, the large turn-outs by Diaspora Rwandans on election day and the resounding endorsement they gave to Kagame tell a different story.	Wabula, okukomawo ennyo kw'Abanyalwanda okuva mu nsi z'ebweru ku lunaku lw'okulonda n'engeri ey'amaanyi gye baawagiramu Kagame yayawukana ku ngeri ebintu gye byali bisuubirwa.
Yet one ought not to stop at the popular endorsement that President Kagame has won.	Ate nga wandisuubidde nti tekyandikomye ku kuwagira Pulezidenti Kagame nti awangudde.
Rwanda is the only country in the region that has demonstrated the organizational capacity to conduct transparent elections.	Rwanda lye ggwanga lyokka mu kitundu eriraze obusobozi bw'okuteekateeka akalulu ak'amazima n'obwenkanya.
The enormity of this achievement becomes more striking when one considers Rwanda as 2nd poorest country among the East African countries.	Obuzibu bw'obuwanguzi buno bufuuka ekyewuunyisa ng'omuntu atwala Rwanda okuba eggwanga eryokubiri ku gasinga obwavu mu mawanga g'obuvanjuba bw'Afirika.
"In a recent profile of Kagame by the Financial Times of London, Tom Burgis, quoted; ""he`s sitting on an ethnic time bomb."""	"Mu bikwata ku Kagame aba Financial Times of London bye baakamufulumyako, Tom Burgis, yagamba nti; ""atudde ku bbomu enaatera okutulika."""
This claim is loved by diplomats and aid workers whose knowledge of Rwanda and interactions with locals are often superficial.	Okusaba kuno kwagalwa abakungu n'abagabi b'obuyambi ng'amagezi gabwe ku Rwanda n'okukwatagana ne bannansi gatera okuba amatuufu.
It is argued that Rwanda is set to explode into violence any time.	Kigambibwa nti essaawa yonna Rwanda eyinza okubaamu obutabanguko essaawa yonna.
The less restrained among them argue that those being denied a voice are the Hutu population.	Abatatulugunyizibwa nnyo mu bo bagamba nti abo abataweebwa mukisa gwa kwogera be Bahutu.
I do not claim that Rwanda is guaranteed never to become unstable again.	Sigamba nti kyankomeredde nti Rwanda teriddamu kubaamu butabanguko.
There is no guarantee that the Hutu are currently denied a voice.	Sikyankomeredde mu kiseera kino nti Abahutu tebawulirizibwa.
If there are Hutu that have been denied a voice, it is those who aspire to exploit their identity for political purposes.	Bwewaba nga waliwo Abahutu nga baganiddwa okwogera, be bo abagala okukozesa ekyo kye bali ku lw'ensonga z'ebyobufuzi.
Frederick Golooba Mutebi said that he has listened to some women claiming that their husbands are in prison on genocide charges.	Frederick Golooba Mutebi yagamba nti awuliddeko abakazi abamu nga bagamba nti abaami baabwe bali mu kkomera ku misango gy'ekittabantu.
It is important to note that even the Tutsi are not free to use ethnicity as a political tool.	Kya makulu okukitegeera nti n'Abatutsi tebalina ddembe okukozesa eggwanga ng'eky'okulwanyisa mu byobufuzi.
The Rwandan government has been characterized as hostile to the press by media rights groups.	Ebitongole ebiryanirira eddembe lya bannamawulire bigamba nti gavumenti y'e Rwanda ebadde etyoboola nnyo eddembe ly'abannamawulire.
As for President Kagame, the best label the France-based Reporters could come up with was ‚Äòmedia predator' or something to that effect.	Eri Pulezidenti Kagame, erinnya erisinga bannamawulire b'e France lye baalina okuvaayo nalyo liri‚ Äòmedia predator'.
The media in Rwanda are much more restrained in their assessment of Kagame and his government compared to Uganda.	Amawulire mu Rwanda gateekebwamu amaanyi ku ngeri gye googeramu ku Kagame ne gavumenti ye bw'ogeraageranya ne Uganda.
It is true that since the France based Reporters took over power, journalists have fled or been prosecuted for various offences.	Kituufu nti okuva omusasi w'amawulire asinziira mu Bufalansa lwe yafuna obuyinza, bannamawulire bawanganguse oba okuvunaanibwa emisango emingi .
One journalist was murdered following what international media allege was his investigation into the shooting of Lt.Gen. Kayumba in South Africa.	Munnamawulire omu yatibwa olw'amawulire g'ensi yonna okugamba nti yali anoonyereza ku kukubibwa kwa Lt. Gen. Kayumba amasasi mu South Africa.
Taken together without reference to context, these things easily raise questions about both President Kagame and his government.	Okutwalira awamu nga tetufudde ku mbeera, ebintu bino bireeta wo ebibuuzo ku Pulezidenti Kagame ne gavumenti ye.
But there are also important aspects of Kagame's relationship with the media that critics do not talk about.	Era waliwo ensonga enkulu ez'enkolagana ya Kagame ne bannamawulire abakolokosi bye batoogerako.
Kagame has also held many long meetings with members of the media fraternity, during which frank views have been exchanged.	Kagame atuuzizza enkungana enkungaana empanvu nnyingi ne bannamawulire mwe bawanyisiganyirizza ebirowoozo ebirungi.
I have a recording of President Kagame condemning a government minister at one press conference.	Nina eddoboozi lya Pulezidenti Kagame ng'anenya minisita wa gavumenti mu lukungana lwa bannamawulire olumu.
Kagame's view was that, it should be a matter for the courts to sort out between individual journalists and aggrieved parties.	Endowooza ya Kagame yali nti yalibadde nsonga ya kkooti okwawula wakati wa bannamawulire ssekinoomu n'ebibiina ebyemulugunya.
Anyone in the media would know that it is divided over the criticisms rights groups throw at President Kagame and his government.	Oyo yenna ali mu mawulire yanditegedde nti kyawuddwamu eddembe ly'ebibinja abikolokota Pulezidenti Kagame ne gavumenti ye.
"At a media conference held in Rwanda in July this year, several journalists denounced the ""self appointed champions of media freedom""."	Mu lukungaana lwa bannamawulire olwali e Rwanda mu Gwomusanvu omwaka guno, bannamawulire abawera bagaana abaali beeronda nga abawanguzi mu kulwanirira eddembe lya bannamawulire.
It is not enough to argue that Kagame is a dictator and another genocide is likely unless freedom of speech is respected.	Tekimala kugamba nti Kagame nnakyemalira era ekittabantu ekirala kyandibaawo okuggyako ng'eddembe ly'okwogera lissiddwamu ekitiibwa.
Rwanda's politics is heavily shaped by the country's history of periods of state-planned violence, ethnic and regional discrimination and restrictions.	Ebyobufuzi bya Rwanda byetooloolera nnyo ku byafaayo by'emivuyo ebitekebwawo gavumenti, amawanga, obusosoze mu bitundu n'obukwakkulizo.
If we see the Hutu elect Kagame and Rwandan Patriotic Front, we should recall that they have been victims of dirty politics.	Bwe tulaba nga Abahutu balonda Kagame ne Rwandan Patriotic Front, tulina okujjukira nti babaddenga beenyigira mu byobufuzi ebijjudde emivuyo.
There are things the post-genocide government, the Rwandan Patriotic Front and President Kagame could be criticized for.	Waliwo ebintu gavumenti eze oluvannyuma lw'ekittabantu, Rwandan Patriotic Front ne pulezidenti Kagame by'erina okunonyezebwako.
They should also join Rwandans in celebrating the RPF's vast achievements which will leave a permanent imprint on the country.	Era balina okwegatta ku Banyalwanda mu kujaguza obuwanguzi kwa RPF's obujja okuleka omukululo ogw'olubeerera ku ggwanga.
Kagame may not take them to that destination, but he has helped them navigate some of its most difficult stages.	Kagame ayinza obutabatuusa mu kifo ekyo wabula abayambyeko okubayisa mu biseera ebisinga okuba ebizibu.
