Amon Mbekiza's comment in New Vision, July 19, 2010, on the July 11 terror attacks in Kampala missed one key point.	Endowooza ya Amon Mbekiza mu New Vision w'omwezi ogwomusanvu nga 19, 2010 ku bulumbaganyi bw'ekitujju mu Kampala yabulamu ensonga enkulu emu.
As we mourn the dead, we must ask; whose political, economic interests does Uganda serve by being in Somalia?	Nga tukungubagira omugenzi, tulina okwebuuza bigendererwa by'ani ebyebyobufuzi n'ebyenfuna bannayuganda bye batuukiriza e Somalia?
The insurgency in northern Uganda has lasted over 20 years.	Akasambattuko mu bukiikakkono bwa Uganda kaamala emyaka egisoba mu 20.
Millions of Ugandans were born during the rebellion and entered adulthood before it ended.	Obukadde bwa bannayuganda bwazaalibwa mu lutalo ne bakula nga terunaggwa.
While some peace has returned, people in northern Uganda think the war has subsided, not ended.	Wadde emirembe emisaamusaamu gikomyewo, abantu mu bukiikakkono bwa Uganda balowooza nti olutalo lusiriseemu so terunaggwa.
The war cannot be pronounced over' unless Joseph Kony and his top commanders are captured or killed.	Olutalo terusobola kulangirirwa nti 'luwedde' okuggyako nga Joseph Konny n'abaduumizi be ab'oku ntikko bakwatiddwa oba nga battiddwa.
I find Mbekiza's criticism of President Obama and Clinton misplaced.	Ndaba nga Mbekiza okukolokota Pulezidenti Obama ne Clinton tekisaana.
President Obama is not an African head of state.	Ssuubi okufaananako ne Kabaka Yekka kijja kwesamba Buganda, omuyaga gw'ebyobufuzi omupya ogwatandikiddwawo bammemba ba Democratic Party abatali bamativu.
Ssuubi like Kabaka Yekka will simply isolate Buganda, the new political pressure group formed by some disgruntled Democratic Party members.	Ssuubi okufaananako ne Kabaka Yekka ekyajja kwesamba Buganda, omuyaga gw'ebyobufuzi omupya ogwatandikiddwawo bammemba ba Democratic Party abatali bamativu.
This reflects a repeat of the Kabaka Yekka Uganda People's Congress unholy alliance of 1961 to deny Benedict Kiwanuka of Democratic Party	Kino kyeyolekera mu kkobaane ly'omukago ogutaali mulungi ogwa Kabaka Yekka ne Uganda People's Congress ogwa lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga mu gumu okugaana Benedict Kiwanuka owa Democratic Party.
The Kabaka Yekka allied with the Uganda Peoples Congress but the marriage crumbled in 1966 when the Kabaka was forced to flee to exile.	Kabaka Yekka yeegatta ne Uganda People's Congress naye omukago gwasaanawo mu lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga mu mukaaga Kabaka bwe yakakibwa okugenda mu buwanganguse.
In spite of Buganda abandoning the Democratic Party for Uganda People's Congress in the 1960s, Democratic Party remained its honest and only ally.	Wadde nga Buganda yasuulawo Democratic Party n'edda ku Uganda People's Congress mu myaka gya lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga, Democratic Party yasigala nga ye munywanyi waayo yekka ow'amazima.
Democratic Party now remains in the hearts of the majority of the Baganda, a big reason why Ssuubi members faced resistance in Masaka.	Democratic party kati esigala mu mitima gy'Abaganda abasinga, ensonga enkulu lwaki bammemba ba Ssuubi baasanga okuvuganyizibwa mu Masaka.
Ssuubi 2011 was formed by some people who didn't want a non Muganda to take the Democratic Party leadership.	Ssuubi mu nkumi bbiri kkumi na gumu yatandikibwawo abantu abataayagala muntu ataali Muganda okutwala obukulembeze bwa Democratic Party.
Ssuubi 2011 was formed by those who were opposed to the election of Norbert Mao from the north.	Ssuubi mu nkumi bbiri kkumi na gumu yatandikibwawo abo abaali baawakanya okulondebwa kwa Norbert Mao okuva mu bukiikakkono.
Democratic Party refused to join the Inter-Party Cooperation because it has no serious future plan other than removing Museveni.	Democratic party yagaana okwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina kubanga tegulina biseera bya mu maaso bisimbiddwako ssira ng'oggyeko okuggyako Museveni.
The arrogance exhibited by Forum for Democratic Change leaders especially when Democratic Party suggested reforms was self-explanatory.	Amalala agaayolesebwa abakulembeze ba Forum for Democratic Change naddala nga Democratic Party esaba enkyukakyuka gaali geyoleka lwatu.
Democratic Party said not all parties can bring the same numbers in the Inter-Party Cooperation to elect one flag bearer.	Democratic party yagambye nti ebibiina byonna tebisobola kuleeta muwendo gwa bammemba gwe gumu mu mukago ogutaba ebibiina okulonda anaabikwatira bendera omu.
How sure are we that delegates will not be donated to such parties?	Tukakasa tutya nti abakiise tebaagabweyo eri ebibiina ebo?
For Democratic Party to just enter Inter Peoples Congress is to deny Ugandans a choice.	Democratic party okumala gayingira mu Inter Peoples Congress kya kumma Bannayuganda eky'okulondako.
For members in Ssuubi to say they will support Mao in the congress while roaming with Forum for Democratic Change shows their intentions.	Bammemba ba Ssuubi okugamba nti bajja kuwagira Mao mu mukago ng'ate bakolagana ne Forum for Democratic Change kiraga ebiruubirirwa byabwe.
Parties like Conservative Party, Social Democratic Party, the Justice Forum don't have roots even in Kampala.	Ebibiina nga Conservative Party, Social Democratic Party, Justice Forum tebirina mirandira wadde mu Kampala.
Buganda has been a serious victim of deceit.	Buganda erimbiddwa nnyo.
In 1961 allied with Uganda Peoples Congress but betrayed in 1967.	Mu lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga mu gumu yeegatta ne Uganda People's Congress naye n'eriibwamu olukwe mu lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga mu musanvu.
In the 1980s Buganda was promised a federal system of governance by National Resistance Movement but has been denied to date.	Mu mwaka gwa lukumi mu lwenda kinaana Buganda yasuubizibwa aba National Resistance Movement enkola ya Federo naye egimmiddwa okutuuka leero.

Thus, Ugandans should not ask what Obama and Clinton have done to castrate the African terrorists.	N'olwekyo Bannayuganda tebalina kubuuza ki Obama ne Clinton kye bakoze okumalawo abayeekera ba Africa.
Rather we should ask what the African nationals are doing to liberate Africa from bad governance and poverty.	Wabula tulina kubuuza ki Abafirika kye bakola okununula Africa okuva mu bukulembeze obubi n'obwavu.

I don't agree with those who support the government's position to launch a full-scale war on Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia.	Sikkiriziganya n'abo abawagira ekirowoozo kya gavumenti eky'okuggulawo olutalo ku bamukwatammundu ba Al-Shabaab mu Somalia.
The attack on Al-Shabaab is a very small part of the War on Terror, certainly not the heart of it.	Obulumbaganyi ku Al-Shabaab katundu katono nnyo ku lutalo lw'obutujju, si gwe mutima gwabwo.
I disagree with President Museveni's war drums.	Sikkiriziganya na kya Pulezidenti Museveni ku ngoma z'olutalo.
At this time, I don't understand our need to go to war with Al-Shabaab despite the recent bombs in Kampala.	Mu kiseera kino, sitegeera bwetaavu bwaffe okugenda mu lutalo ne Al-Shabaab ng'oggyeko bbomu ezaali mu Kampala gye buvuddeko.
Perhaps some Ugandans are contented with Museveni's reasons.	Oboolyawo Bannayuganda abamu bamativu n'ensonga za Museveni.

Though the National Resistance Movement spokesperson is trying to downplay Ssemwogerere Mulwanyamuli's role on Uganda's political scene, National Resistance Movement and President Museveni feel politically threatened.	Newankubadde omwogezi wa National Resistance Movement agezaako okufeebya omulimu gwa Ssemogerere Mulwanyamuli mu byobufuzi bya Uganda, National Resistance Movement ne Pulezidenti Museveni bawulira batidde mu byobufuzi.
That is why the government is now pursuing him using National Social Security Fund, labelling his Ssuubi 2011 political group a Kabaka Yekka party.	Eyo y'ensonga lwaki gavumenti egezaako okumulemerako nga ekozesa National Social Security Fund ng'etuuma ekibiina kye eky'ebyobufuzi Ssuubi nkumi bbiri kkumi na gumu ekibiina kya Kabaka Yekka.
Konny Jovia Ssuubi inquired if Kabaka Yekka was opportunism to the Muganda peasant	Konny Jovia Ssuubi yabuuza oba Kabaka Yekka yali nakigwanyizi eri Omuganda owa wansi.

Democratic Party and National Resistance Movement are the real friends of Buganda.	Democratic Party ne National Resistance Movement gye mikwano gya Buganda egya ddala.
The Inter-Party Cooperation, Forum for Democratic Change and Uganda Peoples Congress are not true friends of Baganda	Omukago ogutaba ebibiina, Forum for Democratic Change ne Uganda Peoples Congress si mikwano gya Baganda emituufu.

I can foresee with certainty that Buganda will remain the worst loser even if IPC wins the election in 2011.	Nsobola okulaba ebinaabaawo nga nsinziira ku bukakafu nga Buganda ejja kusigala ng'ewanguddwa nnyo, IPC ne bw'enaawangula okulonda mu nkumi bbiri mu kkumi na gumu.

New research shows that African elections are far from promoting democracy on the continent.	Okunoonyereza okupya kulaga nti okulonda kw'Abafirika kuli wala nnyo n'okutumbula Demokulasiya ku Ssemazinga.
Finance Minister Syda Bbumba's recently announced national budget was made with the two thousand eleven elections in mind.	Minisita w'ebyensimbi Syda Bbumba yalangiridde gye buvuddeko nti embalirira y'eggwanga yakolebwa n'okulowooza ku kalulu ka nkumi bbiri mu kkumi na gumu.
Government critics claimed that the national budget read out in the Uganda Parliament is full of politics.	Abakolokota Gavumenti bagamba nti embalirira y'eggwanga eyasomeddwa mu Paalamenti ejjudde ebyobufuzi.
New research conducted in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Ivory Coast demonstrates that elections held in Africa have an impact.	Okunoonyereza okuggya okwakoleddwa mu Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda ne Ivory Coast kulaga nti okulonda okubeerawo mu Afirika kulina ekikuvaamu.
It is one of the few things which presents challenges in elections in different elections in countries in Africa.	Ky'ekimu ki bintu ebitono ebireetawo okusoomoozebwa mu kulonda okw'enjawulo mu mawanga ga Afirika.
In Uganda, it is shown that the economic reforms that the country was pursuing leading up to the election were not going to work.	Mu Uganda, embeera eraga nti enkyukakyuka mu byenfuna eggwanga bye lyali liruubirira nga ligenda mu kulonda tebijja kukola.
African finance ministers and reformers who are known for their fiscal discipline are usually fired around election time.	Baminisita b'ebyensimbi aba Afirica ne bannankyukakyuka abamanyiddwa olw'engeri gye bakwatamu ensimbi batera okugobwa ng'ebiseera by'okulonda bigenda kutuuka.
War, guns and votes also show unsuprisingly that voting decisions in African countries are based on ethnic voting blocks.	Olutalo, emmundu n'obululu nabyo byewuunyisa nti okusalawo ku kulonda mu mawanga ga Afirika kwesigamizibwa ku biwayi by'amawanga.
A case study of two Ugandan state ministers is shown.	Okusoma ku baminisita ba Uganda ababeezi babiri kulagiddwa.
An alumni from Makerere University focuses on winning re-election to the Uganda Parliament.	Eyasomerako e Makerere aluubirira okuwangula akalulu akaddiddwamu okugenda mu Paalamenti ya Uganda.
The member of parliament who bet his re-election on perfromance lost the election while ethnic posturing won the day.	Omubaka wa Paalamenti eyeesigamya okuddamu okulondebwa kwe ku ngeri gye yali akolamu yawangulwa abantu bwe baalonda nga beesigamye ku ggwanga.
Further evidence that Barrack Obama could never win an African election can be found here.	Obujulizi obulala nti Barrack Obama tasobola kuwangula kalulu ka Afirika kusobola kusangibwa wano.
Besides, quality information on governmental performance in Africa is scanty and hard to come by.	Ng'oggyeko, obubaka obukwata ku mutindo gw'ebyo Gavumenti bye zikoze butono era buzibu bwa kufuna.
Think of Iraq under Saddam Hussein and today's dysfunctional Iraqi democracy.	Lowooza ku Iraq wansi wa Saddam Hussein ne demokolasiya w'Abayiraaka owa leero atakyakola.
Ethnic violence in Kenya is usually rife during elections such as those in two thousand two and two thousand seven.	Obutabanguko bw'amawanga mu Kenya butera okubalukawo mu biseera byokulonda ng'obwo obwa nkumi bbiri mu ebiri ne nkumi bbiri mu musanvu.
Interestingly, the rough and tumble of African elections discourages decent African candidates from competing for political office and instead encourages some not so well suited candidates.	Ekyewuunyisa, okulonda kwa Afirika okuzibu era okw'obumenyi bw'amateeka kulemesa abantu abalungi okwesimbawo okuvuganya wabula ate abatalina busobozi ne bavuganya.
Mu mawanga agakyakula abeesimbyewo batera okwogera ebisasamaza abalonzi ne bamenya amateeka.	Mu mawanga agakyakula abeesimbyewo batera okwogera ebisasamaza abalonzi ne bamenya amateeka.
Uganda is not short of examples in this regard.	Uganda erina ebyokulabirako bingi mu kiti kino.
After all winning an election in Africa can mean immunity from prosecution and he who reins of state power controls the judicial machinery as well.	Ekirungi kya byonna okuwangula akalulu m Afirica kikusibozesa obutavunaanibwa ku bw'egugungo obubalukawo kubanga ali mu buyinza y'afuga n'ebitongole ebiramuzi.
Collier presents research by Pedro Vicente in Sao Tome which found that candidates who bribed voters won as compared to those who did not.	Abeesimbawo abagulirira abalonzi bawangula bw'ogeraageranya n'abo abatagulirira.
It is an empirical fact that bribery wins elections in poor countries.	Kya mazima ag'enkukunala nti okugulirira abalonzi kuwangula okulonda mu mawanga agakyakula.
After all African voters do not expect that the competing politicians will deliver on their promises and elections are their only chance to cash in.	Oluvannyuma lwa byonna abalonzi ba Abafirika tebasuubira nti bannabyabufuzi abavuganya kutuukiriza bweyamo bwabwe era okulondebwa kusinziira ku ssente z'otaddemu.
Some politicians will actually be seen again four years later at the next election.	Bannabyabufuzi abamu baakuddamu okulabibwako oluvannyuma lw'emyaka ena mu kulonda okuddako.
Collier and Pedro, during the two thousand seven Nigerian election determined that electoral bribery and vote miscounting were used to win elections.	Mu kulonda kwa nkumi bbiri mu Nigeria baakakasa nti okugulirira abalonzi n'okubala obubi obululu byakozesebwa okuwangula okulonda.
War, guns and votes is an insightful reading into how electoral democracy has had the opposite effect in African countries.	Olutalo, emmundu n'obululu bulaga engeri Demokulasiya w'okulonda bw'akoze ekikontana n'ebyo ebyasuubirwa mu nsi za Afirika.
Since Uganda was bombed in July two thousand eleven, Al-Shabaab terrorist group in Somalia claimed responsibility.	Okuva Uganda lwe yakubibwa bbomu mu Gwomusanvu mu nkumi bbiri kkumi na gumu, akabinja k'abayeekera ba Al-Shabab mu Somalia keewaana okukola obulumbaganyi.
There has been a lot of tough talk in Kampala.	Wabaddewo okwogeza obukambwe kungi mu Kampala.
President Yoweri Museveni has promised to hit back at Al-Shabaab by increasing our troops in that country.	Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni asuubizza okwesasuza aba Al-Shabaab ng'ayongera amagye mu ggwanga eryo.
Many Ugandans support the government in its posturing for a surge.	Bannayuganda bangi bawagira Gavumenti mu ngeri gy'edduukiriramu enjega eno.
Yet the surge will increase rather than reduce the problem of the fragmentation of the state in Somalia.	Enjega ejja kweyongera okusinga okukendeeza obuzibu mu mawanga agataaguddwataaguddwa mu Somalia.
It will also increase the financial and human cost on the state of Uganda.	Kijja kwongera okufiiriza Uganda ensimbi n'abantu.
No amount of Uganda Peoples Defence Forces' presence in Somalia will bring peace to that country.	Tewali muwendo gwa magye ga Uganda mu Somalia gujja kuleeta mirembe mu nsi eyo.
Only Somalis' can.	Abasomaali bokka be basobola.
Uganda's troops can only assist in peace building if there are strong internal forces with a strong vested interested in peace.	Amagye ga Uganda gasobola kuyambako buyambi mu kuzzaawo mirembe singa wabaawo eggye ery'omunda ery'amaanyi nga lyagala okukuuma emirembe.
Somalia needs a war lord able to mobilise reources and build a military capability to take effective control of the entire country.	Somalia yeetaaga omuduumizi w'amagye asobola okukungaanya ebintu ebyetaagisa n'okuzimba eggye eririna obusobozi okukuuma obulungi eggwanga lyonna.
The crisis of the state in Somalia, though initially created by internal factors, has been worsened by international interference in its domestic politics.	Akasambattuko mu Somalia wadde nga kaatandikibwawo embeera okuva mu ggwanga munda, kasajjuddwa amawanga gw'ebweru okweyingiza mu byobufuzi byalyo.
Indeed it is part of the wider African dilemma.	Mu butuufu kitundu ku kusoomoozebwa ku Afirika okw'awamu.
Quality information on governmental performance in Africa is scarcely a basis of voter choice as compared to ethnic identity and loyalty.	Obubaka ku mutindo gw'enkola za Gavumenti mu Afirika butono olw'okusalawo kw'abalonzi okwesigamiziddwa ku mawanga n'okwewaayo.
Voting decision in African countries are not based on government performance as is the case in the west.	Okusalawo mu kulonda mu mawanga ga Afirika tekwesigamizibwa ku kukola kwa Gavument nga bwe kiri mu Bazungu.
Elections held in Africa increase political violence, ethnic tensions, electoral bribery and imprisonment of formidable opposition candidates.	Obutabanguko bw'ebyobufuzi, okutya kw'amawanga, okugulirira abalonzi n'okusiba ab'oludda oluvuganya abamanyiddwa.
The July eleven twin bomb blasts in the city that killed seventy six people and left dozens of others injured.	Okubwatuka kwa bbomu ebbiri mu Gwomusanvu nga kkumi na lumu mu kibuga kwatta abantu nsanvu mu mukaaga n'abalala nkumu ne basigala n'ebisago.
Mr. Okumu said the reason why they have ordered National Social Security Fund to pay people who were affected by the Sunday night disaster.	Okumu yayogedde ensonga lwaki baalagidde National Social Security Fund okusasula abantu abaakosebwa ekikangabwa ky'ekiro kya Ssande.
Mr Grace Isabirye told that on July fourteen all the bomb victims will be paid the money they saved with National Social Security Fund. Uganda Peoples Defence Forces last week approved one hundred ninety six strong Joint Anti-terrorism Taskforce to secure the search and fight against terrorists .	Grace Isabirye yagambye nti nga kkumi na nnya Ogwomusanvu bonna abaakosebwa bbomu bajja kusasulwa ssente ze baatereka ne National Social Security Fund.
The fight against terrorism in Uganda was inspired by the terror attacks that happened on July eleven in the country.	Okulwanyisa obutujju mu Uganda kwava ku bulumbaganyi bwa bbomu obwaliwo mu ggwanga nga kkumi na lumu Ogwomusanvu.
Kunsa also underscores the need for a thorough legal framework behind the Bill.	Kunsa naye tawagira kya bwetaavu bwa kakiiko k'amateeka akaali emabega w'ebbago lino.
Grace Isabirye, Onegi Obel, Amama Mbabazi former Managing Director, David Jamwa and Ezra Suruma are going to be hear today.	Grace Isabirye, Onegi Obel, Amama Mbabazi eyaliko ssenkulu, David Jamwa ne Ezra Suruma bagenda kubeera wano leero.
The Independent randomly interviewed some workers who save with the National Social Security Fund.	Independent yabuuza abamu ku bakozi abatereka ne National Social Security Fund.
There have been numerous complaints about the inefficiencies of National Social Security Fund, and the never ending scandals.	Wabaddewo okwemulugunya kungi ku nkola embi eya National Social security fund n'emivuyo egitaggwa.
John Matovu said that if government chose to allow competitors to National Social Security Fund perhaps we would see improved service.	John Matovu yagambye nti singa gavumenti esalawo okukkiriza abavuganya National Social Security Fund oboolyawo tuyinza okulaba ng'obuweereza bulongooka.
Joan Nantume wished that people could save with any organization they wanted instead of National Social Security Fund.	Joan Nantume afundako nti singa abantu basobola okutereka n'ekitongole kyonna kye baagala ekitali National Social Security Fund.
I have been saving with National Social Security Fund for 10 years now.	Mbadde ntereka ne National Social security Fund okumala emyaka kati kkumi.
Gilbert Okello from Mukwano Group of companies said he will get them some time, even if government changed.	Gilbert Okello okuva mu Mukwano Group of Companies yagambye nti ajja kubawaayo obudde Gavumenti ne bw'enaaba ekyuse.
Government needs to craft this law well maybe setting a minimum interest rate on the workers' savings, says Immaculate Akanyo.	Gavumenti yeetaaga okutereeza etteeka lino oboolyawo ng'essawo amagoba eg'essalira ku ssente z'abakozi eziterekebwa, Immaculate Akanyo bwe yategeezezza.
According to the Independent issue of July 23 - 29, 2010, by John Njoroge, the air is pungent with urine, fecal matter and cow dung.	Okusinziira ku Independent ow'Ogwomusanvu 23-29, 2010, ebyawandiikibwa John Njoroge, empewo ejjudde ekivundu ky'omusulo, obubi n'obusa.
This is Kifumbira, a slum in Kamwokya, a suburb of Kampala city.	Eno ye Kifumbira, enzigotta mu Kamwokya, esangibwa ku nkingizzi z'ekibuga Kampala.
This issue is not exclusive to Kifumbira; the suburbs of Kawempe, Kalerwe, Wandegeya, Bwaise, Kisaasi, Kiwatule, Kitintale and Banda are also affected.	Embeera eno teri mu Kifumbira yokka, enzigotta eza Kawempe, Kaleerwe, Wandegeya Bwaise, Kisaasi, Kiwatule, Kitintale n'e Bbanda.
At the Kitintale market, used needles, bandages and syringes are openly dumped with domestic food waste.	Ku katale k'e Kitintale, empiso ezikozeseddwa, bbandeegi, bisuulibwamu lujjudde.
In late November 2009, Ronald Mukasa, fell ill after he stepped on a needle while looking for plastic bottles and scrap metal in a rubbish dump.	Mu Museenene wa 2009 ng'aggwaako, Ronald Mukasa yalwala oluvannyuma lw'okulinnya ku mpiso bwe yali anoonya obucupa bwa pulasitiika n'ebyuma ebikadde mu kasasiro.
He developed an extremely high temperature, and began losing consciousness and he was then rushed to Mulago National Referral Hospital.	Yafuna omusujja ogw'amaanyi n'afuna n'obukosefu ku bwongo oluvannyuma n'addusibwa mu ddwaliro ekkulu e Mulago.
He was rushed to Kamwokya Christian Caring Community Centre, a health centre in the Kamwokya area.	Yaddusiddwa mu kalwaliro ka Kamwokya Christian Caring Community Centre.
Doctors there revived him but Mukasa died a few days later of tetanus while at Mulago Hospital.	Abasawo b'eyo baamukolako naye Mukasa oluvannyuma lw'ennaku ntono yafa obulwadde bwa ttetanansi bwamuttira e Mulago.
We show the Minister for Primary Health, James Kakooza, some photos from Kifumbira.	Tulage minisita w'ebyobulamu ebisookerwako, James Kakooza ebimu ku bifaananyi okuva mu Kifumbira
"The problem is the ""I don't care"" attitude of people in Kampala especially."	Obuzibu bwa nkola ya bantu b'omu Kampala okusinga ey'obutafaayo.
There are hospitals in the rural areas, both government and private where people can go instead of coming to Kampala.	Waliwo amalwaliro ga Gavumenti mu bitundu by'ebyalo n'ag'obwanannyini abantu gye basobola okugenda okusinga okujja e Kampala.
However, according to the Commissioner of Clinical Services at the Ministry of Health Jacinto Amandwa, the problem goes well beyond attitude.	Wabula, okusinziira ku mukungu w'amalwaliro ku minisitule y'ebyobulamu, Jacinto Amandwa ekizibu kya maanyi ddala.
Amandwa, is suddenly shocked and saddened when he views the pictures.	Amandwa, yeewuunyizaawo era n'anyolwa bwe yalabye ebifaananyi.
Amandwa apportions part of the blame to the Uganda Medical Council, the licensing body for private hospitals in Uganda.	Amandwa omusango agusalira kibiina ekigatta abasawo ekiwa layisinsi amalwaliro ag'obwanannyini mu Uganda.
According to the independent issue of July 23 - 29, 2010, many are operating without clear medical waste disposal channels.	Okusinziira ku Independent ow'Ogwomusanvu 23-29, 2010, mangi gakola nga tegalina watuufu we gasuula kasasiro avudde mu ddwaliro.
The Uganda's Healthcare Waste management system Plan of 2007/08-2009/10 suggested that, it should collect and destroy waste.	Enteekateeka y'enkwata ya kasasiro eya nga 2007/08-2009/10, yateesa nti, erina okukungaanya era eyokye kasasiro.
Major hospitals like Mulago National Referral Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Nsambya and Kibuli have their own incinerators.	Amalwaliro amanene nga ekkulu ery'e Mulago, St. Francis Hospital, Nsambya ne Kibuli galina ebyuma byago ebyokya kasasiro.
The government has a burner in Nakasongola but hospitals and clinics do not have burners.	Gavumenti erina we bayokyeza kasasiro e Nakasongola naye amalwaliro amanene n'obutono tebulina we bayokyeza kasasiro.
Health facilities retain the duty of transporting their waste to collection centres from where contracted companies pick it and take it to Nakasongola.	Amalwaliro gasigaza obuvunaanyizibwa bw'okutwala kasasiro waago mu bifo w'akungaanyizibwa kkampuni ezaapatanibwa we zimuggya okumutwala e Nakasongola.

Ahimbisibwe adds that the centre pays Shs. 2000 for every kilo of medical waste it transports to Kisenyi.	Ahimbisibwe agattako nti eddwaliro lisasula 2000/- ku buli kkiro ya kasasiro w'eddwaliro atwalibwa mu Kisenyi.
A spot survey of private medical units in Kifumbira Kamwokya reveals that many private clinics are not willing to pay these additional disposal costs.	Okunoonyereza ku malwaliro g'obwannannyini mu Kifumbira mu Kamwokya kulaga nti amalwaliro g'obwannanyini mangi si meetegefu kusasula ssente za kasasiro zino ez'ennyongereza.
At Kasee Clinic, one of 12 private medical units within a 200 metre radius, an attendant was initially helpful but suddenly became hostile.	Ku ddwaliro ly'e Kasese, akamu ku busenge 12 ak'obwanannyini mu bbanga lya mmita 200, omujjanjabi okusooka yali wa mugaso naye oluvannyuma yafuuka mukambwe.
Life clinic and Nyange clinic also offered very rude responses.	Amalwaliro nga Life clinic ne Nyange clinic nago gaweereza bulungi.
"""We don't want journalists here""one attendant shouted in Luganda before slamming her door."	Omujjanjabi omu yaleekaana mu Luganda nti, ''tetwagala bannamawulire wano'' nga tannagalawo luggi lwe.
Unrecognized by government and the Ministry of Health, these illegal clinics operate without letters from the medical council.	Olw'obutakkirizibwa gavumenti ne Minisitule y'ebyobulamu, amalwaliro ago agatali mu mateeka gakola nga tegalina bbaluwa kuva mu kakiiko akafuga abasawo.
Many clinics in Kampala, Wakiso, Mukono and central region do not have professional people working in them.	Amalwaliro mangi mu Kampala, Wakiso, Mukono ne mu kitundu ky'omu masekkati tegalina bakugu bagakolamu.
According to Ahimbisibwe, slum dwellings like Kifumbira-Kamwokya are ideal for unregistered private medical centres to operate.	Okusinziira ku Ahimbisibwe, enzigotta nga Kifumbira-Kamwokya zirabika zirimu amalwaliro agatali mawandiise kukola.
"""You do not expect such people to be responsible,"" Ahimbisibwe notes in frustration."	Tosuubira bantu abo kuba na buvunaanyizibwa, Ahimbisibwe bwe yagambye mu busungu.
Mulago Hospital is a shining example of how medical waste disposal is supposed to work.	Eddwaliro ly'e Mulago kyakulabirako ekirungi ku ngeri enkwata ya kasasiro w'eddwaliro gy'erina okuba.
With three incinerators, Mulago boasts an organised and elaborately systematic method of medical waste management.	N'ebyuma bisatu ebyokya kasasiro, Mulago erina enkola ennambulukufu ey'okukwatamu kasasiro.
Plastic bottles are recycled, domestic waste is collected by Kampala City Council and human body parts are taken to the mortuary grounds in Bukasa.	Obucupa obwa pulasitiika buddamu okusaanuusibwa, kasasiro w'awaka akung'aanyizibwa Kampala Capital City Authority n'ebitundu by'emibiri gy'abantu bitwalibwa mu ggwanika e Bukasa.
But for the residents of Kifumbira Kamwokya, just two kilometres away, Mulago's organisation offers little comfort.	Naye mu batuuze b'e Kifumbira Kamwokya, abawukanako kkiromita bbiri zokka, enteekateeka ya Mulago ebagumya kitono.
Used needles, syringes and blood transfusion tubes were dumped in Kifumbira, Kamwokya.	Empiso ezikozeseddwa, ebbomba ezivaamu eddagala ly'empiso n'obupiira obuyisibwamu omusaayi byali bisuulibwa mu Kifumbira - Kamwokya.
Mulago Hospital has an incinerator.	Mulago erina ekyuma omwokyebwa kasasiro.

The sprawling Nakivale Refugee Settlement in south-western Uganda is home to over 50,000 asylum-seekers and refugees.	Enkambi y'ababundabunda eya Sprawling Refugee Settlement mu bukiikakkono bw'obugwanjuba bwa Uganda maka g'ababundabunda n'abanoonyiboobubudamu 50,000.
Okumu asked whether the government should come in as a guarantor or rely on the weak insurance market that characterises our economy?	Okumu yabuuza oba Gavumenti erina okujja ng'omusembi oba yeesigame ku nkola ya yinsuwa ennafu eri mu ggwanga?
This was done for easy supervision and conducting routine operations directed by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.	Kino kyakolebwa okwanguya okulondoola wamu n'okukola ebikwekweto ebikolebwa ekitongole ekinoonyereza ku buzzi bw'emisango.
The actions by the former Allied Democratic Forces reporters if not checked can be a recipe for disaster.	Ebikolwa by'abawandiika ku baaliko bamukwatammundu ba Allied Democratic Forces singa tebikolebwako biyinza okuvaamu obuzibu.
The demand for the reinstatement of the former Allied Democratic Force liaison office at the Container Village cannot be entertained.	Obwetaavu bw'okuzzaawo woofiisi z'abaaliko bamukwatammundu ba Allied Democratic Force ku Container Village tebusobola kukkirizibwa.
Lieutenant Col Buturo dismissed the proposal of setting up an office even after numerous complaints from the wananchi.	Luteenanti Kkano Buturo yagoba okusaba kw'okussaawo woofiisi wadde nga abantu ba bulijjo baali beemulugunyizza nnyo.
All these affairs at the former Container Village were used in the name of the Joint-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda which negatively affected its image.	Ensonga zino zonna ezaali ku eyali Container Village zeeyambisibwa mu linnya ly'okussaawo akakiiko akalwanyisa abatujju mu Uganda ekyayonoona ekifaananyi kyakyo.
There are active serving Uganda People's Defense Force soldiers who need to observe and abide by rules and regulations of the army.	Waliwo abajaasi ba Uganda People's Defence Force abaweereza abeetaaga okugondera amateeka n'ebiragiro by'amagye.

The Arab world whose agenda and accountability cannot be clear and convincing.	Ensi y'Abawalabu ng'ebigobererwa n'embalirira yabyo si nnambulukufu era nga tematiza.
It is wrong for the group to claim that the government negotiated a deal with Ali Bamuze and Muhammed Kigundu and ignored them.	Kikyamu ekibinja okulumiriza nti gavumenti yakola ddiiru ne Ali Bamuze ne Muhammed Kiggundu ate n'ebasuulirira.
The Allied Democratic Forces and Lord Resistance Army leadership are still holed up in the bush fighting the government.	Obukulembeze bwa Allied Democratic Forces ne Lord Resistance Army bukyalemedde mu nsiko bulwanyisa gavumenti.
Therefore, it's irrelevant for the group to claim to work for and on behalf of the Allied Democratic Force.	N'olwekyo tekyetaagisa kibinja kulumiriza nti kikolera oba nti kikola ku lwa Allied democratic force.
It's not true that by the time Rwigyema Shafik was arrested, he was on official Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda duties as alleged.	Si kituufu nti mu kiseera Rwigyema Shafik mwe yakwatibwa, yali ku mulimu gw'akakiiko akalwanyisa abatujju mu Uganda nga bwe kyogerebwa.
Much as he was initially deployed by the Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda in the Busoga region, he was given an official vehicle and a pistol.	Wadde nga yasindikibwa mu kusooka, akakiiko akalwanyisa abatujju mu Uganda mu bitundu by'e Busoga, yaweebwa emmotoka ya gavument ne pisito.
In 2007, after my second contract, I thought maybe I had served enough, but the board said no because of Kamonkoli.	Mu nkumi bbiri musanvu oluvannyuma lwa kontulakiti yange eyokubiri, nalowooza nti nali mpeerezza ekimala naye akakiiko kaagaana olwa Kamonkoli.
Secondly, because of the delays in Kamonkoli, the factory ended up costing much than it should have cost.	Ekyokubiri, olw'okulwawo kwa Kamonkoli, ekkolero lyawunzika nga lisasudde kinene okusinga ku kye lyalina okusasula.
It is true that up to 2008 we had been making profits.	Kituufu nti okutuuka mu nkumi bbiri munaana twali tukola amagoba.

The East African Community goal is clear, a common economic space for all people, a space in which trade, capital, and people move freely.	Ekiruubirirwa ky'omukago gwa East Africa kirambulukufu, ebyensuubulagana ebigatta abantu bonna ku bwereere, ekitundu ng'ebyobusuubuzi, entandikwa n'abantu nga beetaaya awatali kukugirwa.

It was started to serve the British business interests and those settlers in Kenya.	Kyatandikibwa okutuukiriza ebigendererwa by'Abangereza n'abo abaasenga mu Kenya.
Therefore, it came as no surprise that when joint services were established in 1945, Kenya benefited more than Uganda and Tanganyika.	N'olw'ekyo, tekyagwa bugwi nti enkolagana ey'awamu bwe yatandikibwawo mu lukumi mu lwenda mu ana mw'etaano, Kenya yaganyulwa okusinga Uganda ne Tanzania.
Kenya benefitted in terms of value-added to their Gross Domestic Product; more employment benefits and revenue.	Kenya yaganyulwa mu ngeri omwali okwongera omutindo ku byamaguzi byabwe; emirimu n'omusolo.
For instance, in 1971 the East Africa Railways employed 55% Kenyans, 33% Tanzanians and 12 per cent Ugandans.	Ekyokulabirako, mu lukumi mu lwenda nsanvu mu gumu oluguudo lw'eggaali y'omukka olwa East Afirika lwawa Bannakenya ebitundu ataano mu bitaano ku buli kikumi emirimu, ebitundu asatu mu bisatu ku buli kikumi baali Batanzania n'ebitundu kkumi na bibiri ku buli kikumi baali Bannayuganda.
Kenya also had a higher manufacturing base than either Uganda or Tanzania, a situation that persists to date.	Kenya era yalina amakolero mangi okusinga ku Uganda ne Tanzania, embeera eyo ebaddewo okutuusa leero.
To correct this uneven situation the British colonial government established the Raisman Commission in 1960.	Okutereeza embeera eya kyekubiira eno, gavumenti y'abafuzi b'amatwale eya Bungereza yateekawo akaiiko ka Raisman Commission mu lukumi mu lwenda nkaaga.
According to Professor Brown, who was a member of the Commission, Kenya gained the most from the common market.	Okusinziira ku Polofeesa Brown, eyali mmemba ku kakiiko kano, Kenya ye yasinga okuganyurwa mu katale k'awamu.
Uganda gained marginally and Tanzania broke even.	Uganda yafunamu kitono ate yo Tanzania yavaamu n'okuvaamu.
Therefore, fiscal compensation to Tanganyika and Uganda through the distribution tool was recommended, as one of the solutions to this inequity.	N'olw'ekyo, kyasalibwawo okuliyirira Tanzania ne Uganda mu by'ensimbi nga bagabana ebikozesebwa ng'omu ku kaweefube w'okumalawo obutali bwenkanya buno.
The sums involved were far short of what would be needed to lead to the development of industries in Uganda and Tanganyika.	Ssente ezaateekebwamu zaali ntono nnyo okusinziira ku zaali zeetaagibwa okukulaakulanya eby'amakolero mu Uganda ne Tanganyika.
The sums that would be considered adequate were too high for Kenya to accept.	Ssente ezanditwaliddwa nti ze zimala zaali nnyingi nnyo nga kizibu Kenya okuzikkirirza.
I am now wondering what exactly was negotiated recently by the architects of the East African Community to address this situation.	Kati nneebuuza ddala biki ebyateesebwako jjuuzi wakati w'abateeseza omukago ogutaba amawanga ga East Africa okusobola okutereeza embeera eno.

I have never met Byarugaba but I have followed press reports about him over time.	Sisisinkanagako Byarugaba naye mbadde ngoberera lipooti ezimwogerwako mu mawulire okumala akabanga.
I was excited by the announcement that he was taking over at National Social Security Fund.	Nasanyukira nnyo ekirangiriro yali alondeddwa ku National Social Security Fund.
He is no doubt better placed to drive National Social Security Fund forward.	Tabuusubwabuusibwa nti y'asaanidde okutwala National Social Security Fund mu maaso.
His previous employment suggests he will make sound decisions in regard to prudent and viable investment of workers' savings	By'akozeeko biraga nti ajja kukola okusalawo okutuufu mu kutereka n'okusiga obulungi ensimbi eziterekebwa abakozi.
He can turn around the pension scheme, increase interest on workers' savings as well as returns on National Social Security Fund investments.	Ayinza okulongoosaamu mu nkola ey'akasiimo, okwongera amagoba ku nsimbi abakozi ze batereka n'okubaddiza ku magoba agaba gavudde mu nsimbi eziba zisigiddwa.
As it is the tradition at National Social Security Fund let us not be quick to shoot him down.	Nga bw'eri enkola ku National Social Security Fund, tuleke kwanguwa kumulemesa.

Since the Uganda People`s Defence Force cannot achieve that goal, the only feasible option is to withdraw from Somalia.	Olw'okuba nti Uganda People's Defence Force tesobola kutuukiriza kigendererwa ekyo, engeri yokka esobola okukolebwa kwe kuva mu Somalia.
We can then, as a member state of the UN, ask the UN Security Council for a mandate forcefully invade Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab.	Awo nno nga bammemba ba UN tusobola okusaba UN Security Council ejje mu Somalia ku mpaka efutize Al-Shabaab.
This strategy would allow Uganda to launch attacks against the Al-Shabaab.	Enkola eno yandisobozesa Uganda okukola obulumbaganyi ku Al-Shabaab.

During its National Executive Conference in January, the NRM declared it had registered 8 million members including the under age.	Mu lukiiko lwa National Exective Conference mu Gatonya, NRM yalangirira nti yali ewandiisizza bammemba obukadde 8 omuli n'abatannaweza myaka.
This was before the EC started the national voter registration exercise which also yielded about 15 million voters, up from 10 million in 2006.	Kino kyaliwo nga EC tennatandika nkola ya kuwandiisa balonzi era kyayambako okutuusa  abalonzi okukunukkiriza obukadde 15 okuva ku bukadde 10 mu 2006.
The NRM has been registering people it calls its members across the country.	NRM ebadde ewandiisa abantu b'eyita bammemba baayo okwetooloola eggwanga.
The Electoral Commission also doubts the authenticity of the NRM figures.	Akakiiko k'ebyokulonda nako kabuusabuusa obutuufu bw'omuwendo gwa NRM.
Early this year, the NRM also doubted the genuineness of the EC's national voter register, alleging that it contained two million ghost names.	Ku ntandikwa y'omwaka guno, NRM nayo yabuusabuusa obutuufu bw'enkalala z'abalonzi eza EC ng'erumiriza nti zaalimu amannya ag'empewo obukadde bubiri.
Uganda's demographic statistics put the 2009 population projections to 30.6 million.	Embalirira y'abantu mu Uganda mu 2009 eteebereza abantu okubeera mu bukadde 30.6.
This implies that 14.2 million Ugandans are above 18 and thus qualified to register as voters.	Kino kitegeeza nti bannayuganda obukadde 14.2 bali waggulu w'emyaka 18 n'olw'ekyo bakkirizibwa okwewandiisa ng'abalonzi.
Population estimates published by the Population Secretariat rise even more questions on the Electro Commission's 15 million voters.	Enteebereza y'omuwendo gw'abantu eyafulumizibwa eggwandiisizo  eteekawo ebibuuzo bingi ku balonzi obukadde 15 obw'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda.
The estimates for 2010 show Ugandans of 18 years and above are 13.9 million, up from 12.9 million in 2008.	Enteebereza ya 2010 eraga bannaganda ab'emyaka 18 n'okusukkawo bali obukadde 13.9 okuva ku bukadde 12.9 mu 2008.
Given the high apathy among Ugandans to register for voting and death of some registered voters, the number of new voters would be fewer.	Olw'okuba nti bannayuganda tebaagala nnyo kwewandiisa kulonda n'okufa kw'abalonzi abamu abeewandiisa, omuwendo gw'abalonzi abapya gwandibadde mutono.
However, the EC has said this is not the final figure.	Newankubadde, EC egambye nti guno si gwe muwendo ogw'enkomeredde.
Some MPs in the NRM have already accused the secretariat of creating ghost members on the register which could facilitate rigging the primaries.	Ababaka abamu mu NRM bamaze okunenya eggwandiisizo olw'okutondawo bammemba ab'empewo ku lukalala ekiyinza okuleetawo okubba obululu mu kamyufu.

This had been done by some NRM officials for selfish interests.	Kino kyali kikoleddwa abakungu ba NRM abamu abeeyagaliza ebyabwe.
The NRM deputy spokesman Ofwono Opondo has said that not all 9 million party registered members are eligible to vote as 1 million are minors.	Amyuka omwogezi wa NRM Ofwono Opondo agambye nti si bammemba b'ekibiina bonna obukadde 9 abaawandiisibwa nti balonzi abatuukiridde kuba akakadde 1 si balonzi.
However,a big question is; who will stop a 16 year old registered NRM member from voting if they registered with the EC ?	Wabula ekibuuzo ekinene kiri nti; ani anaatangira mmemba wa NRM ow'emyaka 16 okulonda singa baba nga beewandiisa ne EC?
Statistics show that Uganda's population has been growing at the rate of 3.2 per annum since 2003.	Ebibalo biraga nti obungi bwa bannayuganda bubadde bukulira ku bitundu 3.2 buli mwaka okuva mu 2003.
Godber Tumushabe, ED of ACODE, a local think-tank on public policy analysis, is skeptical about the NRM claim of 9 million members.	Godbler Tumushabe, ED wa ACODE, omutunuulizi w'embeera z'abantu, abuusabuusa NRM okugamba nti erina bammemba obukadde 9.
It was not proper for the National Resistance Movement to register before the national Electoral Commission exercise.	Tekyali kituufu National Resistance Movement okuwandiisa nga Electoral Commission tennatandika mulimu.

At their weekly press conference, the EC chairperson Eng Kiggundu told the public that they hadn't lent their registration kits to the NRM as alleged.	Ku lukungaana lwa banamawulire olwa wiiki eno, ssentebe wa EC yinginiya Kiggundu yagambye abantu nti tebaapangisa ba NRM byambalo byabwe mwe bawandiisiza abantu nga bwe kirumizibwa.
The NRM has been registering its voters using registration kits that resemble the ones of the EC in the recent national voter registration exercise.	NRM ebadde ewandiisa abalonzi baayo ng'ekozesa kiiti z'okuwandiisa ezifaanaana eza EC mu kuwandiisa abalonzi okubaddewo gye buvuddeko.
There have been allegations in some media outlets that EC lent out its equipment to certain political parties to enable them register supporters.	Wabaddewo ebibadde byogerebwa ku mikutu gy'amawulire egimu nti EC yapangisa ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ebimu ebintu byayo by'ekozesa mu kuwandiisa abantu okubisobozesa okuwandiika abalonzi.
"""The commission categorically denies this allegation"",Eng. Kiggundu said."	Akakiiko keeganira ddala ebyogerebwa bino, yinginiya Kiggundu yagamba.
Kiggundu said that they concluded the update of the national voters' register on June 18, 2010 and retrieved all the equipment from the field.	Kiggundu yagambye nti baamaliriza okuzza obuggya enkalala z'abalonzi nga 18 ogwomunaana, 2010 era ne baggya ebikozesebwa byonna mu bantu.
He said the equipment would be packed and sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after completion of data transfer.	Yagamba nti ebikozesebwa bya kutegekebwa ne bisindikibwa ku minisitule y'ensonga z'omunda oluvannyuma lw'okumaliriza okusindika obubaka.
According to Kiggundu, by July 13, the EC had uploaded 4,670,585 voters, which constitute 97% of the voters they registered in the last registration.	Okusinziira ku Kiggundu nga 13 Ogwomusanvu, EC yali etaddeyo abalonzi 4,670,585, abaali baweza ebitundu 97% eby'abalonzi be baawandiisa mu kuwandiika okwasembayo.
According to Kiggundu, of the 4,670,585 voters, 4290,634 were registered as new, 326,609 as transferring, and 53,342 whose photos were missing.	Okusinzira ku Kiggundu, ku balonzi 4,670,585, 4,290,634 be baawandisibwa nga bapya, 326,609 nga bakyusa, ne 53,342 nga baali tebalinaako bifaananyi.
The Electoral Commission expects to start displaying the national voter register on August 11 and end it on August 30.	Akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kasuubira okutandika okutimba enkalala z'abalonzi nga 11 Ogwomunaana era kufundikirwe nga 30 Ogwomunaana.
This means the EC has most of its equipment lying idle when they could earn money needed to boost their election budget if they rented them out.	Kino kitegeeza nti ebikozesebwa bya EC ebisinga tebirina kye bikola era bandifunyeemu ssente okwongera ku mbalirira yaabwe singa babipangisa.
However, the Electoral Commission spokesman Paul Bukenya said the constitution does not allow them to do income generating business.	Wabula, omwogezi w'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda Paul Bukenya yagamba nti ssemateeka tabakkiriza kukola mulimu guvaamu nsimbi.
Considering that government has consistently failed to meet the commission's budget, the EC could explore ways of generating its own income.	Okusinziira nti gavumenti ezze eremererwa okutuukiriza embalirira y'akakiiko, EC yandinoonyezza engeri gy'efunamu ssente ezaayo.
Last week, the Electoral Commission had to defend itself why it cannot give every opposition party a copy of the national voters' register.	Wiiiki ewedde, akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kaalina okwewozaako lwaki tekasobola kuwa buli kibiina kivuganya kkopi y'olukalala lw'abalonzi.
The Electoral Commission said it would be too expensive.	Akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kaagamba nti kyandibadde kya buseere nnyo.
If the EC had other sources of revenue other than relying on remittances from the national treasury, it would reduce on such financial constraints.	Singa akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kaalina we kasobola okuggya ensimbi okusinga okwesigama ku ssente entono okuva mu ggwanika ly'eggwanga, kyandikendeezezza ku buzibu bw'ensimbi nga buno.
However, upon growing pressure from the opposition who accused the EC of incompetence, it revised its stand.	Wabula, okusinziira ku maanyi agava mu bavuganya abaanenyezza EC olw'obutaba na busobozi, keetegerezza enkola yaako.
It promised to give the voter registers to the political parties.	Kaasubiza okuwa enkalala z'abalonzi eri ebibiina byobufuzi.
The Electoral Commission management have added that they are in talks with government for additional money for this purpose.	Abaddukanya akakiiko k'ebyokulonda baagasseeko nti bali mu njogerezeganya ne gavumenti okufuna ssente ez'ennyongereza ku nsonga eno.
Electoral Commission denies lending its equipment to National Resistance Movement during the independent July 23 - 29, 2010 election.	Akakiiko k'ebyokulonda keegaana okupangisa National Resistance Movement ebintu byako mu kulonda okwetengeredde okwa nga 23-29, 2010.
"The ""fresh-election-call"" was made in a statement issued by Uganda Patriotic Movement Secretary General Bidandi Ssali in Kampala yesterday."	Omulanga gw'okuddamu okulonda, gwakoleddwa mu sitatimenti eyafulumiziddwa Uganda Patriotic Movement Secretary General Bidandi Ssali mu Kampla eggulo.
The UPM wishes to reiterate to the world and particularly Ugandans that the forthcoming elections will be held under certain conditions.	UPM esuubira okuddira ensi naddala bannayuganda nti okulonda okujja kujja kukolebwa wansi w'obukwakkulizo obumu.
These conditions have already rendered the elections unfair and unfree.	Obukwakkulizo buno bumaze okufuula okulonda obutaba kwa mazima na bwenkanya.
Right from the beginning, it was clear that the Chairman of the Military Commission had motives other than organizing a free and fair election.	Okuviira ddala mu ntandikwa, kyali kirabikirawo nti ssentebe w'akakiiko k'amagye yalina ebigendererwa okusinga okutegeka okulonda okw'amazima n'obwenkanya.
For instance the constituency where our President Yoweri Museveni`s contesting has been unlawfully altered at least three times.	Okugeza mu konsitituwensi Pulezidenti waffe Yoweri Museveni gye yavuganya ebadde ekyusiddwa mu bukyamu ekitono ennyo emirundi esatu.
This includes last week and all in a vain attempt to minimize his support.	Kino kitwaliramu ne wiiki ewedde era mu ngeri y'emu egezaako okukendeeza obuwagizi bwe.
In all cases those who were denied registration were known opponents of UPC .	Mu ngeri zonna abo bonna abaagaaniddwa okuwandiisibwa baali bantu abamanyiddwa nga ba UPC.
The imported foreigners registered were in all cases brought by UPC.	Abagwira abaaleeteddwa ne bawandiisibwa mu ngeri zonna baaleetebwa UPC.
During the nomination exercise, sixteen Uganda Patriotic Movement candidates were disqualified.	Mu kusunsulwamu, abeesimbyewo kkumi na mukaaga aba Uganda Patriotic Movement baasuuliddwa ebbali.
Other UPM candidates were denied nomination on grounds that their ability to speak English was not ascertainable.	Aba UPM abalala baagaaniddwa okusunsulwamu ku bigambibwa nti tebaalina busobozi bw'ogera Lungereza.
These included a Lecturer Mr. Chango Macho and a Catholic Father Rev.Okoth.	Bino mwabaddemu ssaabasomesa mwami Chango Macho ne Faaza Omukatolika Lev. Okoth.
"All our petitions about nominations have been ignored by the Electoral Commission, for example, by the men of ""integrity""."	Okwemulugunya kwaffe kwonna ku kusunsulwamu kugaaniddwa akakiiko k'ebyokulonda, okugeza abasajja abeesimbu.
Up to now, fifteen District Commissioners have been retired arbitrarily by the Chairman of the Military Commission.	Okutuuka kati, bakamisona ba disitulikiti kkumi na bataano baawummuziddwa ssentebe w'akakiiko k'amagye mu ngeri etategeerekeka.
These District Commissioners were also the Returning Officers.	Bakamisona ba disitulikiti bano era be baali bakulira okulonda mu bitundu.
The 15th was fired only two days ago apparently because when Obote went to Rukungiri there was no one to address people.	Ow'ekkumi n'abatano yagobebwa ennaku bbiri emabega kubanga Obote bwe yagenda e Rukungiri tewaaliwo muntu yenna kwogerako eri abantu.
But why did the South African police arrest you?	Naye lwaki poliisi ya South Africa yakukwata?
I fell out with Kabila and returned to Rwanda.	Nayawukana ne Kabila ne nzirayo e Rwanda.
Kayumba is my friend and he knows that I cannot do something like that to him.	Kayumba mukwano gwange era akimanyi nti sisobola kumukola kintu bwe kityo.
Do you still work for Rwandan intelligence?	Okyakolera ekitongole kya Rwanda ekikessi?
I used to be a soldier in the Ugandan army, later, Rwandan army and finally in the Congolese army.	Nali mujaasi mu ggye lya Uganda, ne mmala ne ngenda mu ggye ly'e Rwanda ne nsembayo mu eggye lya Congo.
In Congo, I was the Commanding Officer of the Presidential Guard of Laurent Kabila.	Mu Congo nali mudduumizi w'eggye erikuuma Pulezidenti erya Loteenanti Kabila.
"He spoke to the Independent's Andrew Mwenda on Kayumba`s shooting; ""Karegyeya engineered my detention""."	Yayogerako ne munnamawulire wa Independent Andrew Mwenda ku kukubibwa kwa Kayumba amasasi nti Karegyeya ye yakulemberamu okumukuumira mu kkomera.
He is influential in the government of South Africa and sits on the National Executive Committee of the ruling Africa National Congress.	Wa maanyi mu gavumenti ya South Africa era atuula ki kakiiko akafuzi ak'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza ekya National Congress.
Kayumba was also visited by the South African chief of police and the head of South Africa's military intelligence.	Kayumba yakyalirwa ssaabapoliisi wa South Africa n'akulira obukessi mu magye.
It is said that all these powerful Africa National Congress and government officials were there due to Masetera's influence.	Kigambibwa nti abakungu ba Africa National Congress bano bonna b'amaanyi baaliwo olw'amaanyi ga Masetera.
The involvement of powerful personalities from the South African government has caused some rifts in the relationship between the two countries.	Okwenyigiramu kw'abantu ab'amaanyi okuva mu gavumenti ya South Africa kuleeseewo obutakkaanya mu nkolagana wakati w'amawanga abiri.
Some Rwandan insiders claim it has also biased the investigation into the Kayumba attempted assassination.	Abanyalwanda abamu ab'omunda era bagamba nti kigootaanyizza okunoonyereza ku kugezaako okukuba Kayumba amasasi.
A Rwandan source, told the Independent that Karegyeya was the one giving South African police tips on whom to arrest.	Ensonda okuva mu Rwanda, yategeezezza Independent nti Karegeya ye yali awa poliisi ya South Africa obubaka ku ani abeera akwatibwa.
Gakwerera also claims he was arrested on the advice of Karegyeya.	Gakwerera naye agamba nti yakwatibwa ku magezi ga Karegyeya.
Further, Rwandan officials have openly accused the South African police of incompetence.	Okwongerako, Abakungu mu Rwanda bazze malumiriza poliisi ya South Africa obutaba na busobozi.
They claim that immediately Kayumba was shot, the first people taken to make police statements are those he had in the car.	Bagamba nti amangu ddala nga Kayumba akubiddwa amasasi, abantu abaasooka okutwalibwa okukola sitatimenti ku poliisi be bo be yali nabo mu mmotoka.
However, a South African diplomat worsened things when he mentioned in an interview that the Rwandan government was behind the shooting.	Wabula, omukungu okuva e South Africa yasajjula ebintu bwe yayogerera mu yintaaviyu nti gavumenti ya Rwanda ye yali mabega w'okukuba amasasi gano.
The Kayumba case seems to be setting the relationship between the two nations into a dangerous balance.	Omusango gwa Kayumba gulabise okuteeka enkolagana wakati w'amawanga abiri mu lusuubo olw'obulabe.
But there is more; the Rwandan government had applied for the deportation of Kayumba on charges of terrorism.	Naye waliwo ekisingawo, gavumenti y'e Rwanda yali esabye okukomyawo Kayumba olw'emisango gy'obuyeekera.
On April 6, Spain submitted its own application to deport Kayumba on charges of crimes against humanity.	Nga 6 Ogwokuna, Spain yawaayo okusaba kwayo okuzza Kayumba olw'emisango gy'okutyoboola eddembe ly'obuntu.
Two days later, France also applied for the same.	Nga waakayitawo ennaku bbiri Bufalansa nayo yasaba ky'ekimu.
Kayumba could afford to rubbish Rwanda's claims against him because it is a poor country whose accusations can easily be disregarded.	Kayumba yali asobola okugamba nti Rwanda by'emulumiriza nti tebiriimu nsa kubanga ggwanga lyavu nga bye lyogera bisobola okugaanibwa amangu.
However, France and Spain are powerful nations considered to be mature democracies and reasonable in their actions.	Wabula, Bufalansa ne Spain nsi zikirimaanyi ezitwalibwa okuba ne demokolasiya ow'amaanyi n'ebikolwa eby'amaanyi.
So,their applications could carry more weight with South Africa.	N'olw'ekyo, okusaba kwazo kwali kuzito ne South Africa.
What is clear, however, is that by the time he was shot, Kayumba had begun to reassess his options.	Wabula ekyo ekirabibwako, kirinti mu biseera we yakubibwa amasasi, Kayumba yali atandise okukola okusalawo kwe.
Deportation applications from Spain and France showed that Kayumba and Kagame shared a stronger common threat.	Bufalansa ne Spain okusaba okumuzza, kyalaga nti Kayumba ne Kagame baalina beerinako okutya okw'amaanyi.
This common threat was stronger than the issues that separate them.	Okutya kuno kwali kwa maanyi nnyo okusinga ekibaawula.
So, he began making contact with Kigali.	N'olw'ekyo yatandika okukwatagana ne Kigali.
Kayumba is a close personal friend to Maj.Gen.Steven Kashaka, currently Uganda's military ambassador to South Africa.	Kayumba mukwano nnyo gwa Maj. Gen. Steven Kashaka nga mu kiseera kino ye mubaka w'amagye ga Uganda mu South Africa.
According to Francis Gakwerera, this thing was engineered by Patrick Karegyeya, the former director of Rwanda's External Security.	Okusinziira ku Francis Gakwerera, kino kyayongerwamu amaanyi Patrick Karegyeya, eyali akulembera ebyokwerinda bya Rwanda eby'ebweru.
Whenever I travel through South Africa, I meet and talk with Karegyeya because he is also my friend.	Buli lwe ntambula mu South Africa, nsisinkana era ne njogerako ne Karegyeya kubanga naye mukwano gwange.
He sometimes picks me from the airport whenever I get into South Africa.	Ebiseera embimu ankima ku kisaawe ky'ennyonyi buli lwe ntuuka mu South Africa.
On this occasion, I got into South Africa on Wednesday and called him on Friday, the day before Kayumba was shot.	Ku mulundi guno, Natuuka mu South Africa ku lwokusatu ne mmukubira ku lwokutaano, olunaku lumu nga tannakubwa masasi.
On Saturday, I had a lunch appointment with Karegyeya which he cancelled saying he was going to watch soccer.	Ku lwomukaga, nalina enteekateeka y'okulya ekyemisana ne Karegyeya naye n'agisazaamu ng'agamba nti yali agenda kulaba mupiira.
He later called me saying Kayumba had been shot.	Oluvannyuma n'ankubira ng'agamba nti Kayumba yali akubiddwa esasi n'afa.
I called him thirty minutes later to ask about Kayumba`s state but he said he was busy and promised to call back.	Namukubira oluvannyuma lw'eddakiika asatu okumubuuza ku mbeera Kayumba gye yalimu naye n'agamba nti yali alina by'akolako n'asuubiza okuddamu okunkubira.
I was at the home of Albert Gatare, a brother of the late Miko.	Nali mu maka ga Albert Gatare muganda w'omugenzi Miko omulenzi.
He told me that Kayumba was in Riverside Hospital.	Yangamba nti Kayumba yali mu ddwaliro ly'e Riverside.
It is at that moment that the police called me and said they wanted me.	Mu kiseera ekyo poliisi yankubira n'engamba nti yali eneetaaga.
Nine police men then came in heavily armed.	Abasajja aba poliisi mwenda oluvannyuma bajja nga balina ebyokulwanyisa bingi.
There were many policemen with police dogs.	Waaliwo abapoliisi bangi nga balina embwa za poliisi.
Then on Sunday night, almost 30 hours later, they brought other suspects including Richard who turned out to be Kayumba's driver.	Oluvannyuma ku Sande ekiro, nga waakayita kumpi essaawa amakumi asatu, baaleeta abateeberezebwa abalala omwali ne Richard eyalinga ddereeva wa Kayumba.
The other suspects included two Rwandans, a Kenyan and a Tanzanian.	Abateeberezebwa abalala mwalimu Abanyalwanda babiri, Omunakenya n'Omutanzaniya.
They asked me if I knew any of the suspects and I knew the two Rwandans.	Baambuuza oba nali manyi omu ku bateeberezebwa nga mmanyi Abanyalwanda ababiri.
He told me that he was actually involved in the shooting of Kayumba.	Yangamba nti yali yeenyigira mu kukuba Kayumba amasasi.
He said someone called him on telephone saying his name was Dr. Ndahiro.	Yagamba nti waliwo eyamukubira essimu ng'agamba ye dokita Ndahiro.
He promised to give him two thousand United States dollars if he helped them kill Kayumba that is an enemy of Rwanda.	Yasuubiza okumuwa ddoola z'Amerika enkumi bbiri singa abayambako okutta Kayumba eyali omulabe wa Rwanda.
He said that Dr. Ndahiro promised that the driver would be rewarded by President Paul Kagame if he cooperated.	Yagamba nti dokita Ndahiro yasuubiza nti ddereeva yandisiimiddwa Pulezidenti Paul Kagame singa yali akolaganye nabo.
The driver also said that the shooting was the second attempt on Kayumba's life.	Ddereeva naye yagambye nti okukuba amasasi lwe lwali olulumba olwokubiri ku bulamu bwa Kayumba.
Kayumba was sleeping in his bed with his wife.	Kayumba yali yeebase mu buliri ne mukyala we.
Three days later, he tipped them off when Kayumba and wife were going to the shopping mall.	Ennaku ssatu oluvannyuma, yabatwalako Kayumba ne mukyalawe bwe baali bagenda ku ssemaduuka.
First, I understood him to be referring to Dr.Emmanuel Ndahiro, the head of the National Security Services.	Okusooka, namutegeera ng'ajuliza ku dokita Emmanuel Ndahiro, akulira National Security Services.
So, I asked him if he knew this Ndahiro and he said no.	N'olw'ekyo, namubuuza oba nga yali amanyi Ndahiro ono, n'agamba nti nedda.
So I asked him why he believed that it was Dr. Ndahiro.	N'olw'ekyo namubuuza lwaki yali asuubira nti ye yali dokita Ndahiro.
I was commanding officer of the presidential guard of rebel leader and later President Laurent Kabila.	Nze nali omuduumizi w'eggye erikuuma Pulezidenti w'abayeekera n'oluvannyuma eyafuuka Loteenanti Kabila.
So I know, the story of Kayumba's shooting is all deceptive.	N'olw'ekyo nkimanyi nti emboozi y'okukuba Kayumba amasasi yonna enyumizibwa bunyumizibwa.
Then the killer went over to the side of Kayumba and they had a physical fight.	Awo omutemu n'agenda eri Kayumba ne batandika okulwana.
We were then transferred to John Foster Prison on Monday.	Oluvannyuma ku Mmande twatwalibwa mu kkomera lya John Foster.
Kayumba's driver recorded his statement in my presence and he repeated to the police what he had told me in jail.	Ddereeva wa Kayumba yakola siteetimenti ye nga wendi era n'addamu okugamba poliisi bye yali ang'ambye mu kkomera.
These people were not victimized in any way after the overthrow of Amin.	Abantu bano tebaavunaanibwa oluvannyuma lw'okuggyako Amin.
But there was evidence against them that they aided Amin in Killing Uganda People's Congress members.	Naye waaliwo obujulizi obubalumiriza nti baayambako Amin mu kutta bammemba ba Uganda People's Congress.
Let Kahigiriza come here and contradict my words, if what I say is not correct.	Leka Kahigiriza ajje wano awakanye ebigambo byange, bwe mba nga bye njogera si bituufu.
While addressing another rally in Buzabo's constituency, Muwanga warned saying;	Bwe yabadde ng'ayogera mu lukungaana olulala mu konsitituwensi ya Buzabo, Muwanga yalabudde ng'agamba;
"""Take the message to Buzabo and all the Democratic Party supporters that they must stop the dirty politics immediately""."	Twala obubaka eri Buzabo n'abawagizi ba Democratic Party nti bateekeddwa okukomya ebyobufuzi byabwe eby'emivuyo mu bunnambiro.
The liberty which was brought by the Uganda People's Congress cost people's lives some died in Lake Victoria, others between Mutukula and Arua.	Eddembe eryaleetebwa Uganda people's congress lyaviirako abantu bangi okufiirwa obulamu bwabwe abamu baafiira mu nnyanja Nalubaale abalala wakati wa Mutukula ne Arua.
They sacrificed their lives for the freedom of everyone in Uganda.	Baasaddaaka obulamu bwabwe ku lw'eddembe lya buli omu ali mu Uganda.
Muwanga warned that, members of different parties should not claim to have an upper hand on others by molesting them.	Muwanga yalabude nti bammemba b'ebibiina eby'enjawulo tebateekeddwa kukaayana kubaamu na mukono ogwawaggulu nga banyiiza abalala.
Muwanga talked to the Uganda people's Congress in Mbirizi, Masaka South-West constituency.	Muwanga yayogeddeko eri Uganda People's Congress e Mbirizi mu konsitituwensi ya Masaka South-West.
The 65 year old chairman who effectively participated in last years' liberation war which toppled Amin said:	Ssentebe w'emyaka 65 omwaka oguwedde eyeenyigira obutereevu mu lutalo lw'ameenunula olw'aggyako Amin yagambye;
"""You the youth of Uganda People's Congress will spearhead the reconstruction and development task""."	Mwe abavubuka ba Uganda People's Congress mujja kukulemberamu omulimu gw'okuzzaawo awamu n'okulaakulanya.
"""The first thing the Uganda People's Congress will do as soon as it comes to power will be to engage the youth in productive work."	Ekintu ekisooka Uganda People's Congress ky'ejja okusookera ddala okukola ng'ezze mu buyinza kujja kuba kunyigira bavubuka mu mirimu egizimba.
Uganda People's Congress youths will spearhead this so as to set an example to the rest.	Abavubuka ba Uganda People's Congress bajja kukulemberamu kino okusobola okuteekawo ekyokulabirako eri abalala.
Muwanga also appealed to Ugandans to strive hard and establish mutual respect for each other.	Muwanga era yasaba bannayuganda okufuba ennyo okwewangana ekitiibwa.
At Bwezibwera, the chairman pledged, never again shall the Uganda People's Congress allow Uganda to be humiliated as it was in the Amin's days.	E Bwezibwera, ssentebe yeeyamye, aba Uganda People's Congress tebajja kuddamu kukkiriza Uganda okuddamu okujoogebwa nga bwe kyali mu biseera bya Amin.
Never shall Uganda be characterized with the life of scarcities of essential commodities.	Uganda teribeera mu mbeera ya bbulwa ly'ebintu ebikozesebwa mu bulamu obwa bulijjo.
Uganda People's Congress needs determined characters who would stand with this nation even in difficult times.	Uganda People's Congress yeetaaga abantu abamalirivu abanaayimirira nayo ne mu biseera ebizibu.
Commenting on the Democratic Party led by Paulo Kawanga Semogerere, he said it was characterized by contradictions.	Okwogera ku Democratic Party ekulirwa Paulo Kawanga Semogerere, yagambye nti kwalimu okukontana.
He commended Semogerere for his ability to lead a party which was almost torn apart by contradictions.	Yasembye Semogerere ku lw'obusobozi bwe okukulembera ekibiina ekyali kumpi kitaaguddwataaguddwa okwetema engalize.
The Democratic Party, serious contender with the Uganda People's Congress in the polls, had given away more that 10 parliamentary seats.	Democratic party eyali evuganya ennyo ne Uganda People's Congress mu kalulu, yali eviiriddwako ebifo bya paalamenti ebisukka 10.
I tend to think that Semogerere is only unfortunate to lead such men.	Ngenda ne ndowooza nti Semogerere talina bubeezi mukisa ku kulembera bantu ng'abo.
Otherwise, how can we have the 1980 parliamentary candidates who cannot fill in the forms and present them in time?	Mu ngeri endala, tusobola tutya okuba n'abavuganya ku bubaka bwa paalamenti mu 1980 nga tebasobola kujjuza mpapula ne baziwaayo mu budde.
Nakasi's story is heartbreaking.	Emboozi ya Nakasi emenya omutima.
This series is compiled and reproduced by John Njoroge.	Obutundutundu buno bwakungaanyiziddwa era ne buddamu okufulumizibwa John Njoroge.
According to the independent issued on Jul 30- August 05, 2010, Rosebell Kagumire reported that;	Okusinziira ku Independent eyafulumizibwa nga 30 Ogwomusanvu okutuuka nga 05 Ogwomunaana 2010, Rosebell Kagumire yagamba nti;
A young woman who was returning home outside the countryside town of Soroti was raped.	Omuwala eyabadde adda ewaka wabweru w'ekibuga kya Soroti yasobezeddwako.
The 28 year old Grace Nakasi was a victim of an insurgency in eastern Uganda.	Grace Nakasi ow'emyaka 28 yakosebwa akatabanguko mu bugwanjuba bwa Uganda.
She was pulled off the road to the bush and gang-raped by the men in uniform.	Yasikiddwa okuva ku kkubo n'atwalibwa mu nsiko n'asobezebwako ekibinja ky'abasajja abaali mu yunifomu.
I was living in Soroti town.	Nali mbeera mu kibuga ky'e Soroti.
I met nine soldiers on patrol at about 7:00 pm.	Nasisinkanye abajaasi mwenda ku paatulo ku ssaawa nga 7:00 ez'ekawungeezi.
Nakasi begins her story by narrating how they all raped her and abandoned by the roadside.	Nakasi atandika emboozi ye ng'attottola engeri bonna gye baamusobyako ne bamuleka ku mabbali g'ekkubo.
This was 1987, a year after President Yoweri Museveni had captured the reigns of state power.	Guno gwali mwaka gwa 1987, nga Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni awambye obuyinza bw'eggwanga.
"He announced ""a fundamental change"", not a mere change of guard."	Yalangirira enkyukakyuka ey'omuggundu so si kukyusa bukyusa bakuumi.
The heinous incident marked the dawn of repeated sexual violence against Nakasi and many other women in conflict areas.	Akaseera k'entiisa kano ke kaali entandikwa y'okusobya ku Nakasi entakera n'abakyala abalala abaali mu bitundu ebirimu obutabanguko.
"""I decided to go to the bus park to take a bus to visit my home,"" Nakasi narrates with suppressed sadness."	Nasazeewo okugenda mu paaka ya bbaasi nninnye bbaasi ngende ewange, Nakasi anyumya nga munakuwavu.
It was on the way to the bus park that Nakasi became a victim of the second rape.	Nakasi  asobezebweko omulundi ogwokubiri ku lugendo lwe okutuuka ku paaka ya bbaasi .
"Nakasi narrated, ""I met four National Resistance Army soldiers, two of them dragged me off the road and forced themselves on me""."	"Nakasi ya ttotodde, ""nasisinkanye abajaasi ba National Resistance Movement bana, babiri ku bo ne bansika okuva ku luguudo ne banneekakaatikako."""
Nakasi a mother of 12 children, a resident of Soroti, was raped 16 times, infected with HIV.	Nakasi maama ow'abaana 12, mutuuze w'e Soroti, yasobezebwako emirundi 16, n'asiigibwa akawuka akaleeta mukenenya.
She was later thrown out of her marital home by the enraged husband.	Oluvannyuma yagobebwa baawe omunyiivu mu maka ge ag'empeta.
It's a touching narrative and a wider reflection of the tribulations women face in Africa's conflict-torn regions.	Yabadde mboozi ekwata ku muntu nga yeefumiitiriza ku kaseera akazibu abakazi ke basanga mu bifo bya Afirika ebirimu obutabanguko.
She is one of the faces of Ugandan women that carry the burden of sexual violence.	Y'omu ku bakyala abannayuganda abasanga ekizibu ky'okukabassanyizibwa.
For the past decade Uganda has been applauded on the world stage as a successful story in the fight against Human immunodeficiency Virus.	Mu kyasa ekiyise, Uganda ebadde etenderezebwa ku mutendera gw'ensi yonna ng'erina emboozi ey'obuwanguzi mu kulwanyisa akawuka akaleeta mukenenya.
Women trapped between government soldiers and the LRA rebels have borne the brunt of the HIV.	Abakyala abakwatibwa wakati w'abajaasi ba gavumenti n'abayeekera ba LRA be bali ennyo mu buzibu bw'okukwatibwa akawuka akaleeta mukenenya.
This is more than any other women in the rest of the country.	Kino kisinga omukyala omulala yenna mu ggwanga lyonna.
The prevalent sexual violence by both the LRA and government soldiers has left behind a traumatized and stressed generation of women.	Okukabassanya okugenda mu maaso okwa LRA n'abajaasi ba gavumenti kulese omujiji gw'abakyala nga bali mu kikangabwa n'obweraliikirivu.
In 1990, Nakasi was again gang-raped by men whom she believes were government soldiers.	Mu 1990, Nakasi era yaddamu okusobezebwako b'akkiriza nti baali bajaasi ba gavumenti.
She was admitted to Butabika Mental Rehabilitation Hospital in Kampala for several months after the rape incident.	Yaweebwa ekitanda ku Butabika Mental Rehabilitation Hospital mu kampala okumala emyezi egiwera oluvannyuma lw'okukabassanyizibwa.
In 2002, Nakasi took an HIV test.	Mu 2002, Nakasi yeekebeza akawuka akaleeta mukenenya.
But the day I told him I had tested HIV positive, he threw me out of the house, Nakasi narrates in a tone of courage that has defied many odds.	Naye olunaku lwe namugamba nti nazuuliddwamu akawuka akaleeta mukenenya, yanfulumya mu nnyumba, Nakasi attottola mu ddoboozi ery'obuvumu ekyewuunyisa abantu bangi.
Nakasi was excommunicated from the community.	Nakasi yasosolebwa mu kitundu.
A ray of hope emerged in 2007.	Oluwenda lw'essuubi lwaliwo mu 2007.
Nakasi was rescued by World Vision International which paid for her operation to remove her uterus which helps eliminate the fistula condition.	Nakasi yanunulibwa aba World Vision International abaasasulira okulongosebwa kwe okuggyibwamu nabaana ekyamuyamba okuwona embeera y'ekikulukuto.
After the treatment, she and other women, who are victims of sexual violence, started a support group called Teso Peace Women's Activists.	Oluvannyuma lw'obujjanjabi, ye n'abakyala abalala abaakosebwa okukabassanyizibwa, baatandikawo ekibiina ekiyambi ekiyitibwa Teso Peace Women's Activists.
According to the Independent issue of July 30-August 05, 2010, Rosebell Kagumi wrote about women and girls who are abandoned after rape.	Okusinziira ku Independent eyafulumizibwa nga 30 Ogwomusanvu okutuuka nga 05 Ogwomunaana 2010, Rosebell Kagumi yawandiika ku bakazi n'abawala abasuulibwawo oluvannyuma lw'okukabassanyizibwa.
Nakasi said the young girl's parents died in the war and now at nine no one wants to take care of her yet has six orphans under her care.	Nakasi yagambye, bazadde b'omuwala omuto baafiira mu lutalo era kati ku myaka mwenda tewali n'omu ayagala kumulabirira kyokka ng'alina bamulekwa mukaaga b'alabirira.
Nakasi's story is not unique in Uganda's war-ravaged communities.	Emboozi ya Nakasi si mpya mu bitundu bya Uganda ebyakosebwa olutalo.
She told the Independent that about 40 women within just one sub-county of Tubur in Soroti where she works suffer from vaginal fistula.	Yagambye Independent nti abakyala abakunukkiriza 40 mu ggombolola emu yokka eya Tubur mu Soroti gy'akolera balwadde ba kikulukuto.
This is due to rape.	Kino kiva ku kukabassanyizibwa.
Nakasi and other HIV- positive women regularly walk many miles from Tubur to get life pronging drugs.	Nakasi n'abakazi abalala abalina akawuka akaleeta mukenenya batambula mmayiro nyingi okuva e Tubur okufuna eddagala eribeezaawo obulamu.
Nakasi has managed to get funds from Women's International Cross-Cultural Exchange and Urgent Action Fund Africa.	Nakasi asobodde okufuna obuyambi okuva mu Women's International Cross Cultural Exchange and Urgent Action Fund Africa.
These funds help orphans and provide medicines to people living with HIV in her village.	Obuyambi buno buyamba bamulekwa n'okuwa abantu eddagala abayina akawuka akaleeta mukenenya mu kyalo kye .
It became clear that the new government was there to stay after the late 1990's.	Kyategeerekeka nti gavumenti empya yali ya kubeerawo oluvannyuma lw'emyaka gya lukumi mu lwenda kyenda egyasembayo.
Until then, the Rwandan Patriotic Front had managed to run the country through sheer ingenuity.	Okutuuka olwo, Rwanda Patriotic Front yali esobodde okuddukanya eggwanga ng'eyita mu kugonjoola ebizibu eby'amaanyi.
A small and poor country grappling with problems of the magnitude Rwanda has faced in recently;	Ensi entono era enjavu zirwanagana n'ebizibu eby'enjawulo Rwanda by'eyiseemu gye buvuddeko.
And still faces today cannot be considered normal.	Era n'okutuusa kati ffeesi tezisobola kutegeerekeka.
Most people who visit Rwanda marvel at how clean and orderly Kigali is compared to cities elsewhere in the region and beyond.	Abantu abasinga abagenda e Rwanda beewuunya engeri ekibuga Kigali gye kiri ekiyonjo n'engeri gye kyateekebwateekebwamu.
Remembering his childhood in clean and orderly Entebbe;	Ajjukira obuto bwe mu kibuga Entebbe ekiyonjo era enteeketeeke.
Kalyegira arguably has grounds for asserting that there is nothing impressive about the state Kigali is in.	Kalyegira agamba alina obukakafu nti tewali kisikiriza ku mbeera Kigali gy'erimu.
Nonetheless, that Kigali is the only Rwandan town talked about in these terms merely reflects that many visitors do not venture beyond it.	Ngy'oggyeeko ekyo, Kigali kye kibuga kya Rwanda kyokka ekyogerwako mu mbeera zino, ekiraga nti abagenyi bangi tebalambula kukisukka.
Kigali is not the only clean and orderly town in Rwanda.	Kigali si kye kibuga kyokka ekiyonjo era ekiteeketeeke mu Rwanda.
He has traversed Rwanda over the last decade sometimes as a visitor, other times as a researcher.	Alambudde Rwanda okumala emyaka kkumi egiyise oluusi ng'omugenyi, ebiseera ebirala ng'omunoonyereza.
My adventures have allowed me to observe different aspects of life in Rwanda at close range.	Okulambula kwange kunsobozesezza okulaba ebintu eby'enjawulo mu Rwanda nga mbiri kumpi.
A perceptive visitor to any place in Rwanda cannot fail to notice evidence of the high quality of public administration the country.	Omugenyi omwekkaanyi mu kifo kyonna e Rwanda tayinza kulemwa kulaba mutindo ogwa waggulu ogw'okukulemberamu abantu mu ggwanga eryo.
Also the service delivery in the country.	N'obuweereza obuliwo mu ggwanga.
The regular cleaning and garbage collection seen in Kigali is, for example, evident in towns, big and small across the country.	Okulongoosa okwa buli lunaku n'okukung'aanya kasasiro okulabibwa mu Kigali, okugeza kirabibwako mu bibuga, ebinene n'ebitono okwetoloola eggwanga.
The reason why all this is impressive is not because it happens only in Rwanda, or that it has never happened anywhere else.	Ensonga lwaki kino kisikiriza teri nti kubanga kiri Rwanda yokka, oba nti tekibangawo awantu awalala wonna.
Rather, it is because it happens in a country which only 16 years ago was expected to dig itself deeper into chaos and violence.	Wabula, kiri nti lwakuba kiri mu ggwanga eryali lisuubirwa okwenyigira mu mivuyo n'obutabanguko mu myaka kkumi na mukaaga gyokka egiyise.
Thus add a new statistic to Africa's many failed and failing states.	N'olw'ekyo gatta omuwendo omuggya ku nsi za Afirika ennyingi eziremereddwa n'eziremererwa.
Only RPF cadres and RPA soldiers who had organised a war and successfully defeated a better equiped and resourced army;	Akabinja ka RPF n'abajaasi ba RPA bokka abaali bateeseteese olutalo ne bawangula eggye eryali teteekeddwateekeddwa obulungi era nga lirina buli kyakukozesa.
Expected to see a functioning and effective state in less than a generation.	Suubira okulaba eggwanga eritambuzibwa obulungi ng'omugigi tegunnayitawo.
Most rural folks possess medical insurance which entitles them to quality services which their counterparts in neighbouring countries.	Abantu b'omu byalo abasinga balina yinsuwa z'obulamu ekibayamba okufuna obuweereza obulungi ekiringa ne bannaabwe abali mu nsi ez'oku muliraano.
These include countries like Uganda, could not possibly expect.	Muno mulimu amawanga nga Uganda, agatasuubirwa.
In health sphere, Rwandans do not expect to offer bribes to public servants employed to deliver services to which they are entitled.	Mu byobulamu, Abanyalwanda tebasuubira kugulirira bakozi ba gavumenti abasuubirwa okutuusa obuweereza bwe bateekeddwa okutuusa.
Given the country's demographics, most of the beneficiaries of these advances are members of the majority Hutu population.	Okusinziira ku muwendo gwabwe, abasinga okuganyulwa mu buweereza buno be Bahutu abasinga obungi.
This is thanks to propaganda by past regimes.	Kino kwebaza eri abasaasaanya amawulire agalaliiko mitwe na magulu mu mirembe egyayita.
Commentators of a particular bent may sneer at the Rwanda government's democratic credentials.	Batunuulizi bandyekkaanya engeri Rwanda gy'ekwatamu ensonga ya Demokulasiya.
In Rwanda, police and army officers do not make political statements praising the Rwanda Political Front or criticising its opponents.	Mu Rwanda, poliisi n'abaamagye teboogera siteetimenti za byabufuzi nga batendereza Rwanda Political Front oba okukolokota abagivuganya.
Hutu and Tutsi who qualify under the law are free to participate, without restriction or special privileges linked to ethnicity.	Abahutu n'Abatuusi abatuukiriza eteeka ba ddembe okwetaba awatali kukugirwa oba okuweebwa ekintu kyonna nga kyesigamizibwa ku ggwanga.
They can participate as candidates or supporters of any of the country's legally registered political parties.	Basobola okwesimbawo oba okuwagira ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi byonna ebyawandiisibwa mu mateeka.
Journalists working for state media are not fired for hosting leaders of parties other than the Rwanda Political Front.	Bannamawulire abakolera omukutu gw'eggwanga tebagobebwa olw'okukyaza abakulu b'ebibiina abatali ba Rwanda Political Front.
Under the supremacist Habyarimana and Kayibanda regimes this kind of ‚Äòfreedom for all' was unthinkable.	Mu mirembe gya Supremacist Habyarimana ne Kayibanda, eddembe lya bonna nga lino lyali terirowoozebwako.
Another sphere in which the robustness of the Rwanda state can be discerned is law enforcement.	Embeera endala eyeenyumirizibwamu mu ggwanga lya Rwanda eri mu kwasisa y'amateeka.
In some, including several of Rwanda's neighbours, having laws on the statute books is one thing, enforcement is another.	Mu zimu, nga mw'otwalidde ne baliraanwa ba Rwanda abawerako, okubeera n'amateeka mu bitabo kirala n'okugakwasisa kirala.
In Rwanda, the state's willingness and capacity for law enforcement explains why the impunity which some of us have come to accept.	Mu Rwanda, embeera y'okweyagalira n'obusobozi bw'okukwasisa amateeka kinnyonnyola lwaki tusobola okukkiriza obutabonerezebwa.
It explains it as a fact of life in our countries is virtually unknown.	Kikinnyonnyola ng'eky'amazima mu nsi zaffe ekitamanyiddwa.
There are no untouchables, which explains why, regardless of what they may think of President Kagame as individuals.	Tewali bannantakwatwako, ekinnyonnyola lwaki, ne bw'oba nga ki ky'olowooleza Pulezidenti Kagame ng'omuntu.
Then there are those who think he could be less strict and more compromising.	Era waliwo abo abalowooza nti ayinza okuba omugonvu oba obutafa kw'ekyo kye bakoze.
There are also no cases of the high and mighty erecting buildings in total disregard of planning regulations and suffering no consequences.	Era tewaliiwo misango gya kugaana bizimbe bizimbiddwa nga tebiri ku ppulaani n'obutakozebwa bivaamu.
And yet others have theirs demolished.	Ate ng'abalala ebyabwe bisaanyiziddwawo.
Important personalities and ordinary folk, Hutu and Tutsi, soldier and civilian, all live in equal fear of, and respect for, the law.	Abantu ab'omugaso n'aba bulijjo, Abahutu n'Abatuusi, abajaasi n'abantu ba bulijjo banna babeera mu kutya kwe kumu n'okussa ekitiibwa mu mateeka.
"On law enforcement, Kalyegira is, of course, right to argue that ""a state is not just about buildings, street lights or a functional civil service""."	Mu kukwasisa amateeka, Kalyegira mutuufu okugamba nti eggwanga teriri ku bizimbe, mataala g'oku nguudo oba obuweereza eri abantu.
It is too early to call Rwanda an African success story, as it is inappropriate to call it a normal country.	Ekiseera kikyali okuyita Rwanda olugero lwa Afirika olw'obuwanguzi, ng'era bwe kitali kituufu okuliyita eggwanga erya bulijjo.

Mubatsi Asinja HabatiIf says if you plan to seek the services of the Uganda police, prisons service, Mulago Hospital, any court, or UMEME;	Mubatsi Asinja Habatilf agamba nti bw'oba oteekateeka okusaba obweereza bwa poliisi, obw'amakomera, Eddwaliro ly'e Mulago, oba UMEME:
You must be ready to bribe.	Olina okubeera omwetegefu okugulirira.
The East African Bribery Index, a governance tool used to measure bribery levels says that no service is offered in the private and public sectors.	East African Bribery Index, ekikozesebwa kya gavumenti okupima eddaala ly'enguzi kigamba nti tewali buweereza bugabibwa mu bitongole by'obwannannyinga ne mu bya gavumenti.
The Uganda Revenue Authority is slightly different than other national services that were surveyed.	Uganda Revenyue Authority eyawukanamu katono ku bitongole ebirala ebyanoonyerezebwako.
The survey interviewed people in the East African Community member states of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.	Okunonyereza kwetabibwamu abantu okuva mu nsi za East Afirika okuli Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda ne Burundi.
The survey was carried out by Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog.	Okunoonyereza kwakolebwa Transparency International, ekitongole ekirondoola obuli bw'enguzi.
URA was found to be the institution with the highest aggregate index of all indicators, which means it performed worst on the bribery index.	URA yasangibwa okuba nga kye kitongole ekisinze okukola obubi nnyo mu bibalo by'enguzi ekitegeeza nti yali ekoze bubi nnyo bwe kituuka ku nguzi.
It replaced the Uganda police, which was worst in the survey last year, but moved up to the second worst position this year.	Kyasikira poliisi ya Uganda eyali yasinga okukola obubi mu kunoonyereza kw'omwaka ogwayita n'edda mu kifo ekyokubiri omwaka guno.
Regionally, Uganda is the second worst performer on the bribery index after Burundi.	Mu kitundu, Uganda yeeddirira Burundi mu kulya enguzi.
Rwanda is by far the best performer with a corruption prevalence of only 6.6 percent.	Rwanda teriimu nguzi nga eno eri ku bitundu 6.6 ku buli kikumi byokka.
Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi have bribery prevalence of 33 percent and dont expect service at URA, police and UMEME without a bribe.	Uganda, Kenya ne Burundi enguzi eri ku bitundu 33 ku buli kikumi era tusuubira buweereza ku URA, Poliisi ne UMEMR nga towadde nguzi.
The report does not provide much information about why there is minimal corruption in Rwanda.	Alipoota tewa bubaka bungi ku lwali enguzi ntono mu Rwanda.
However, it shows that the Rwandan Ombudsman enforces the government's zero tolerance against corruption.	Wabula, kiraga nti omukugu w'e Rwanda afuba okulaba nga tewali wadde enguzi mu gavumenti.
In 2009, the Finance Director at the Presidency of Rwanda was suspended from office.	Mu 2009, akulira ebyensimbi mu woofiisi ya Pulezidenti yagobwa mu woofiisi.
He was sentenced to four years in prison following corruption allegations.	Yasibwa emyaka ena mu kkomera olw'ebyo ebyekuusa ku buli bw'enguzi.
He was also fined more than one billion Rwandan Francs.	Yatangibwa ensimbi ezisoba mu kawumbi ka ssente za Rwanda.
A former top civil servant in the Rwandan infrastructure ministry was given a similar fine.	Eyali akulira emirimu mu Minisitule ya Rwanda ey'ebyenkulaakulana naye yaweebwa engassi y'emu.
Over 20 of the 30 district mayors in Rwanda were removed from office for alleged mismanagement.	Bammeeya ba distulikiti abasukka mu 20 ku 30 mu Rwanda nabo baagobwa mu woofiisi ku bigambiwa nti bazikozesa bubi.
In Rwanda, the Ombuds-man's office is responsible for reviewing the revenue declarations submitted by top government officials.	Mu Rwanda , woofiisi y'omukugu evunaanyizibwa ku kukebera omusolo oguweereddwayo abakungu ba gavumenti.
These include the president.	Bano mulimu ne Pulezidenti.
In comparison to Uganda where relatively low ranking offenders are arraigned before the anti-corruption court and convictions are rare.	Bw'ogeraageranya ne Uganda abantu aba wansi basimbibwa mu kkooti ewozesa abakenuzi era abavunaanibwa batono.
In Rwanda, only six percent of respondents said that they had actually paid a bribe.	Mu Rwanda, abantu ebitundu mukaaga ku kikumi bokka ku baabuuzibwa be baagamba nti baali basasudde enguzi.
Due to the limited numbers of reported bribery incidents, the index for Rwanda couldn't be formulated by compilers in their report.	Olw'okuba nti abantu batono abawa enguzi, omuwendo gwa Rwanda eyagasse alipoota eno teyagutaddemu.
No other East African country registered high optimism in corruption perceptions compared to Rwanda.	Tewali ggwanga ddala mu East Africa lyalaga bwerufu bwa waggulu ku nguzi bw'oligeraageranya ne Rwanda.
A common new form of corruption used by top government officials in Uganda involves delaying the execution of services to create a crisis.	Engeri empya eriirwamu enguzi ekozesebwa abakungu ba gavumenti mu Uganda erimu okulwawo okutuusa obuweereza okusobola okutondawo obwetaavu obw'amaanyi.
It happened during the CHOGM in 2007 where colossal amounts of public funds were stolen in hurried procurements.	Kyatuukawo mu CHOGM mu 2007 nga ssente za gavumenti nnyingi zabbibwa mu kugula ebintu mu bwangu.
The report says that it's clear that the anti-corruption legislations in Uganda have had little impact thus strengthening the cause to review them.	Alipoota egamba nti kyeraga lwatu nti abalwanyisa enguzi mu Uganda tebalina kye bakozeewo n'olw'ekyo ne kyongera okuleetawo obwetaavu obyekenneenya.
The government's point man in the anti-corruption fight, Minister for Ethics and Integrity, James Nsaba Buturo;	Omukungu wa gavumenti mu kulwanyisa enguzi, minisita w'empisa n'obuntubulamu, James Nsaba Buturo;
Gets defensive when presented with the figures.	Gaana singa obeera ng'osabiddwa enguzi.
He says he doesn't know what safeway Transparency International's surveys use to arrive to its information.	Agamba tamanyi ngeri ki Transparency International z'ekozesa okutuuka ku bubaka buno.
But Jasper Tumuhimbise, an anticorruption activist, has no doubt about the unease.	Naye Jasper Tumuhimbise, alwanyisa enguzi agamba nti talina kubuusabuusa ku kino.
He says that Uganda might top the region in next year's survey.	Agamba Uganda eyinza okusinga mu kitundu mu kunoonyereza kw'omwaka ogujja.
Tumuhimbise adds that Uganda ranks high on corruption.	Tumuhimbise ayongerako nti Uganda ekwata kifo kya waggulu mu buli bw'enguzi.
Apart from Rwanda, all governments in the region appear to lack the will to fight corruption.	Okuggyako Rwanda, gavumenti zonna mu kitundu zirabika nga tezirina busobozi kulwanyisa nguzi.
As a result of this, most citizens do not even bother to report the vice.	Ekiva mu kino, abatuuze abasinga tebafa nayo kuloopa muze guno.
At 41 percent, Uganda has the highest number of respondents saying they do not report bribery cases because no action will be taken.	Ku bitundu 41 ku buli kikumi, Uganda y'esinga omuwendo gw'abaabuuzi abagamba nti tebaaloopa misango gya nguzi kubanga tewali kijja kukolebwa.
In worst-performing Burundi, however, only 17 percent believe it will rise.	Wabula mu Burundi esingamu enguzi, 17 ku 100 bokka be basuubira nti ejja kweyongera.
"""What we need is the release of our money,"" said Odoi."	Twetaaga okuta ssente zaffe, Odoi bwe yagambye.
"""But we see no headway and we can't open the university to the students"", Odoi continued."	Odoi era yayongedeko, tetulabawo kigenda mu maaso era tetusobola kuggulawo ssetendekero eri abayizi.

A clash of faith is emerging at the all African Bishops Conference in Entebbe.	Obukuubagano bw'enzikiriza bubalukawo ku All African Bishops Conference Entebbe.
The six day conference is aimed at fostering unity and breathing new life into the church.	Olusirika olw'ennaku omukaaga lugendereddwamu okunyweza obumu n'okuzza obulamu obupya mu Kkanisa.
"Under the theme, ""Securing the future, unlocking our Potential,"" four hundred Anglicans faith will meet including Rowan Williams."	Wansi w'omulamwa, okutegekera ebiseera by'omu maaso, okusumulula obusobozi bwaffe, Abangirikaani ebikumi bina bajja ku sisinkana nga kw'otadde ne Rowan Williams.
He is the Archbishop of Canterbury.	Ye Ssaabasumba w'e Canterbury.
This is a difficult time for the Anglican faith as the divide between Bishops in Africa and outside continues to grow.	Kano akaseera kazibu eri enzikiriza y'Abangirikaani nga okweyawula wakati w'a bepiskoopi mu Afirika n'ebweru kweyongera okukula.
Archbishop Williams has a substantially more favorable stand on homosexuality and gay Bishops serving in the church than African counterparts.	Ssaabasumba Williams ayina w'asibidde awenkizo ku bepiskoopi abalya ebisiyaga okuwereza mu kkanisa okusinga banne abalala mu Afirika.
The Independent of Aug 27 - Sept 02, 2010 said there is no easy way out of the brutality that confronts the Karimojong civilians today.	Independent eyo gw'omunaana 27 - ogw'omwenda 02,2010,yagamba tewaliiyo ngeri nyangu ya bukaambwe ey'okwenganga aba kalamoja leero.
"As darkness deepens over Karamoja, the National Resistance Movement government continues with its brutal ""disarmament programme""."	Enzikiza gye yeyongera eri aba karamoja, gavumenti ya National Resistance Movement bweyongera obukambwe bwayo mu ntekateka z'okubaggyako ebyo kulwanyisa.
Sadly enough, while this scenario continues, it is business as usual for Ugandans and the rest of the world.	Ekyenaku ekisinga,nga embeera eno ekyagenda mu maaso,Kya bulijjo eri bannayuganda n'ensi endala.
According to available information from Karamoja, the Uganda People's Defence Forces soldiers are conducting a military campaign.	Okusinzira ku mawulire agaliwo okuva e karamoja ,abajaasi ba Uganda People's Defence Force bakola kakuyege w'amagye.
A Pokot chief elder Mzee Aramutori Lokodo, first brought the plight of the Karimojong to the public in February this year.	Omukadde we Pokot Aramutori Lokodo,yasooka kutereeza mbera ya bakalamoja eri abantu mu gw'okubiri omwaka guno.
Then on April 29, 2010, Nicholas Abul, the Kacheri LCIII chairman, was quoted in the media.	Awo ogw'okuna nga 29, 2010,Nicholac Abul,ssentebe wa LCIII owe kacheri,yayogedwako mu mawulire
"""The army should identify the warriors who are armed and those who are not"", Nicholas Abdul said."	Nicholas yagambye nti ,eggye liyina okuzuula abatujju abalina eby'okulwanyisa n'abo abataalina,
During his tour of Karamoja, the Forum for Democratic Change President, Dr Kizza Besigye, saw what was happening there.	Mukulambula kwe e karamoja,pulezidenti wa Forum for Democratic Change,Dr Kizza Besigye yalaba ekyali kigenda mu maaso.
Besigye told journalists at the FDC party headquarters in Najjanankumbi that the abuses take the form of extreme torture.	Besigye yagambye bannamawulire ku kitebe kya FDC e Najjanankumbi nti ebivumo bikola ekika  ky'okutulugunya eky'amaanyi
In the New Vision of May 24, 2010, the Uganda Human Rights Commission said Kotido district residents were panic stricken.	Mu New Vision w'ogwokutaano 24,2010,Uganda Human Rights Commision yagamba, abatuuze mu disitulikiti ye Kotido baagwamu entiisa.
Later, in a meeting with Uganda Human Rights Commission on June 28, the visiting Irish Foreign Affairs minister Michael Martin had some remarks.	Oluvanyuma, mu lukiiko ne Uganda Human Rights Commission nga 28 ogw'omukaaga,minisita w'ensonga z'ebweru eyakyala okuva mu Island Michael Martin aliko bye yayogera.
"""We are concerned about reports on human rights violation against women and children in Karamoja,"" Martin said."	Martin yagamba, tufaayo ku alipoota ezikolebwa ku kutyoboola eddembe lya bakyala n'abaana e karamoja.
"Pokot Member of Parliament, accuses the Elite Special Forces unit of the Uganda People's Defence Forces for the killing ""innocent Pokot people""."	Omubaka wa paalamenti ow'e Pokot, anenya Elite Special Forces unit eya Uganda People's Defence Forces okutta abantu ba Pokot abataalina musango.
Kiyonga also accused the Uganda People's Defence Forces of scalding suspected Karimojong rustlers with hot metals.	Kiyonga naye yanenya Uganda People's Defence Forces okukubisa Abakaramoja abateeberezebwa okuba ababbi b'ente n'ebyuma ebyokya.
"The army spokesman, Leutenant. Colonel. Felix Kulayigye, dismissed the allegations as ""unfounded""."	Omwogezi w'amagye,Leutenant.Colonel.Felix Kulayigye,yasambazze ebigambibwa nga ebitaliiyo.
"On removing people's teeth as a method of torture, Kulayigye said: ""Karimojong people have removed their teeth culturally""."	Mukuggyamu amannyo nga engeri y'okutulugunya, Kulayigye yagambye, abakaramoja baggyemu amannyo gaabwe lwa buwangwa.
Even before the current allegations, another MP wrote to President Museveni and the Commander in Chief about the army's conduct.	Nga nebigambibwa tebinabaawo,MP omulala yawandiikira Pulezidenti Museveni n'omuduumizi w'amagye ku neyisa y'abamagye.
Jie County Member of Parliament told President Museveni that soldiers killed between twenty eight to forty three civilians in April.	Omubaka wa paalamenti ow'essazza lye Jie yagambye pulezidenti Museveni nti abaserikale batta abantu ba bulijjo abali wakati w'abiri mu munaana n'amakumi ana mu basatu mu gw'okuna.
"The president dismissed the allegations as ""baseless"" and that the army was ""doing a good job in ridding Karamoja of guns."	Pulezidenti yasambazze ebigambibwa nga bwe bitayina nsibuko era nti eggye lyali likola omulimu omulungi mu kuggyako abakaramoja emundu.
So such is the tragic situation that has been playing itself in the Karamoja sub-region of North eastern Uganda.	So nno eyo y'embeera ey'entiisa ebadde yeeyolekera mu bitundu by'e Karamoja mu North Eastern Uganda.
"The practice of drawing civilians into the fray of military ""operations"" is the Uganda People's Defence Force's long standing tradition."	Ekikolwa ky'okukwata abantu ba bulijjo mu bikwekweto by'amagye muze gwa Uganda People's Defence Force.
They know that not all Karimojong carry guns.	Bakimanyi nti si buli Mukaramoja nti ayina emundu.
Neither are all Karimojong cattle rustlers, yet they are targeted as if they were.	Si Bakarimajongo bonna nti babbi ba nte, kyokka basongedwamu nga gy'oli nti bali.
This is not to suggest that the Karimojong warriors who terrorise their communities and neighbouring districts should not be held accountable.	Kuno si kuteesa nti abakarimojongo abatabaazi abatigomya ebitundu byabwe ne disitulikiti ezibaliranye tebateekeddwa kuvunaanibwa.
"To the Uganda People's Defence Forces, they are all the same, all ""Karimojong are warriors""."	Eri Uganda People's Defence Forces, bonna bafaanagana ,Bakarimojongo bonna batabaazi
Common sense has to prevail, the Karimojong warriors must be separated from the ordinary civilians.	Amagezi amazaale galina okukola, Bakarimojongo abatabaazi bateekeddwa okwawulibwa ku bantu ba bulijjo.
Museveni hasn't learnt from the twenty five years of the insurgency in Acholi if he expects to rid Karamoja of guns by force.	Museveni tayigidde ku myaka abiri mu etaano egy'obutabanguko mu Acholi bwaba asuubira okuggyako karamoja emundu n'ekifuba.
The Uganda People's Defence Forces continues to target women and children.	Uganda People's Defence Forces eyongera okulubirira abakyala n'abaana.
"""Collective punishment cannot deliver a peaceful Karamoja."" said Olara, a human rights advocate."	Ekibonerezo eky'awamu tekiyinza kuleeta mirembe mu Karamoja, Olara omulwanirizi w'eddembe ly'obuntu bwe yagambye.
The Uganda People's Defence Forces continues to target women and children.	Uganda People's Defence Forces eyongera okulubirira abakyala n'abaana.
It is rare to read an opinion about politics in Uganda in our media whose premise is our reality.	Tekisangika okusoma endowooza ku by'obufuzi mu Uganda ku mikutu gyaffe egy'empuliziganya  nga ekirowoozo ekyo mbeera zaffe za ddala.
Two months ago, two former prime ministers of Buganda Kingdom announced their support for the opposition in the forthcoming elections.	Emyezi ebiiri egyiyise, abaliiko ba katikkiro ba Buganda babiri balangirira obuwagizi bwabwe eri oludda oluvuganya mu kalulu akajja.
Given President Museveni's battles with Mengo over land and federo lately, this was a big public relations coup for our embattled opposition.	Ku lw'entalo za Pulezidenti Museveni ne Mengo ku by'ettaka ne Federo gye buvudeko,luno lwali luwenda lunene eri oludda lwaffe oluvuganya.
In trying to win over ethnic Baganda, the opposition has done little to root itself in their existential problems.	Mu kugezaako okuwangula Abaganda, oludda oluvuganya lukoze kitono okusimba amakanda ku bizibu byalwo.
However, the calculation is obvious that by winning over powerful Baganda leaders to its side, the opposition hopes to leverage their reputation.	Newankubadde ekibalo kirabirwawo nti okuwangula abakulembeze Abaganda abamaanyi okubeera ku ludda lwabwe ,oludda oluvuganya lusuubira okukozesa ekifaananyi kyabwe.
In this lies the fundamental failure of politics in Africa.	Mukino mwe muva ensibuko y'okulemwa eby'obufuzi mu Afirika.
During 2006 presidential election, Museveni got one point six million votes and seventy five point four percent in the West.	Mu kalulu k'obwapulezidenti aka 2006,Museveni yafuna obululu akakadde kamu mu emitwalo nkaaga n'ebitundu nsanvu mu bitaano n'obutundutundu buna mu buvanjuba.
Let us assume the same number of registered voters and the same voter turnout as in 2006.	Katusuubire omuwendo ogw'ewandiisa gwegumu n'omuwendo gw'abalonda mu 2006.
The opposition needs to only force Museveni to a draw in the south east and to forty percent in Buganda.	Oludda oluvuganya lw'etaaga kukaka Museveni basibagane mu South East n'ebitundu ana mu Buganda.
For then the combined vote of the opposition would be three point four five million against Museveni's three point three million votes.	N'olwekyo obululu obugatte obw'aboludda oluvuganya bwandibadde obukadde busatu mu emitwalo ana mu etaano okusinga obwa Museveni obukadde busatu mu emitwalo asatu.
Buganda is therefore the major battle ground region around which Museveni's presidency will be fought.	Buganda n'olwekyo ky'ekitundu ky'eddwaniro ekkulu obukulembeze bwa Museveni we bujja okulwanyisibwa.
If Muliika and Ssemogerere tilt the balance against Museveni in Buganda, it is very likely that we will get another change.	Singa Muliika ne Ssemogerere bakendeeza obululu bwa Museveni mu Buganda, kisuubirwa nti tujja kufuna enkyukakyuka endala.
The worrying feature about democratic politics in Africa is how much elites are able to make bargains at the top.	Ekyeraliikiriza ku nkola y'obufuzi eya demokulasiya mu Afirika y'engeri abayivu gye basobola okulamuziganya  waggulu.
If the opposition can win Buganda simply by entering a deal with a few Baganda elites, it will have little incentive.	Singa oludda oluvuganya lusobola okuwangula Buganda nga bayingira buyingizi mu ddiiru n'abayivu abatono mu buganda, kijja kwetaagisa ebintu bitono.
Politicians in Africa find it more electorally profitable to prioritize the allocation of private goods over pubic goods.	Ab'ebyobufuzi mu Afirika bakisanga nti kifuna nnyo mu byobufuzi okukulembeza ebya maguzi by'obwannannyini ku bya gavumenti.
To dismantle this elite driven politics is the biggest challenge to democratization in Africa.	Okusanyawo eby'obufuzi bino eby'abasoma, kwe kusoomoza okusinga mu kuteekawo dimokulasiya mu Afirika.
This is where the opposition has failed to offer an alternative to National Resistance Movement.	Wano oludda oluvuganya we lulemereddwa okuwa ekikira ku National Resistance Movement .
Even in western democracies, the endorsement of influential elites is important, but only for its symbolic value.	Ne demokulasiya mu mawanga g'abazungu, okusimbawo abayivu ab'amaanyi kya mugaso, naye ku lw'emiganyulo gyabwe.
It is rare to hear an issue based organizational voice backing a candidate in Uganda.	Tekisangika mu Uganda okuwulira eddoboozi ly'ekibiina nga kisemba ey'esimbyewo.
The worrying feature about democratic politics in Africa is how much elites are able to make bargains at the top.	Ekyeraliikiriza ku byobufuzi by'ebibiina ebingi mu Afirika y'engeri abayivu gye basobola okulamuziganyaamu waggulu.
The crisis of democracy in Africa.	Akatuubagiro ka demokolasiya mu Afirika.
Dan Mugarura, the Chairman for Electoral Affairs of the main opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change, is a very worried man.	Dan Mugarura, ssentebe w'ebyokulonda mu kibiina ky'oludda oluvuganya ekisinga amaanyi ekya Forum for Democratic Change, mweraliikirivu.
"""If you can shoot your own child and wife, it means you will tear up your neighbour,"" Mugarura told The Independent."	Mugarura yagambye Independent nti, bwoba osobola okukuba omwana wo ne mukazi wo amasasi, kitegeeza nti osobola okuyuzaayuza muliraanwawo.
He was referring to the violence during the ruling National Resistance Movement party district elections and constituency primaries.	Yali ajuliza ku mivuyo mu kalulu k'ekibiina ekiri mu buyinza ekya National Resistance Movement aka disitulikiti n'akamyufu ka consitituwensi.

The independence of the Electoral Commission is doubted by the opposition parties.	Ab'ebibiina ebiri ludda oluvuganya gavumenti babuusabuusa obwetengereze bw'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda.

National Resistance Movement absence threatens party forum launch.	Obutabaawo bwa National Resistance Movement kissa okutongoza omukago mu kattu.
Last week the police blocked a meeting by the Democratic Party faction led by Samuel Lubega at Nsambya Youth Sharing Hall in Kampala.	Wiiki ewedde poliisi yalemesa olukungaana lw'ekiwayi kya Democratic Party ekikulirwa Samuel Lubega ku Nsambya Youth Sharing Hall mu Kampala.
The meeting was to discuss terms under which they would join the Interparty Cooperation, a loose alliance of five political parties.	Olukungaana lwali lwa kuteesa ku ngeri gye bandiyiseemu okwegatta ku mukago gw'ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ebitaano.
The faction relocated the meeting to Kabusu village and resolved to join the Inter Party Corporation.	Ekiwayi kino kyakyusa olukiiko ne kiruzza ku kyalo Kasubi ne basalawo okwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi.
The officially recognised DP said that they had summoned the five leaders of the Lubega faction to the party's disciplinary committee.	DP emanyikiddwa mu butongole yagamba nti baali baayita abakulembeze b'ekiwayi kya Lubega mu kakiiko k'ekibiina akakwasisa empisa.
Simon Peter Ochieng, said they had not received any letter calling them to appear before the disciplinary committee.	Simon Peter Ochieng, yagamba nti baali tebannafuna bbaluwa yonna ebayita okulabikako eri akakiiko akakwasisa empisa.
He said Mao's group only summoned them through a press conference for publicity purposes.	Yagamba nti ekibinja kya Mao kyabayita buyisi mu lukiiko lwa bannamawulire n'ekigendererwa ky'okumanyibwa.
Ochieng said that Mao's group loves media attention.	Ochieng yagamba nti ekibinja kya Mao kyagala nnyo amawulire.
He said they pulled the same action on August 18 when they went to meet the Inter Party Corporation leaders and called journalists to escort them.	Yagamba nti baakola ekintu kye kimu nga 18 Ogwomunaana bwe baagenda okusisinka omukago ogutaba ebibiina bye byobufuzi ne bayita bannamwawulire okubawerekererako.
Salaam Musumba, approves that Mao's group went to meet the Inter Party Corporation for publicity purposes.	Salaam Musumba, akakasa nti ekiwayi kya Mao kyagenda okusisinkana omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi n'ekigendererwa ky'okumanyika.
Musumba described Mao's decision to meet Inter Party Corporation leaders as a childish check to attract publicity.	Musumba yannyonnyola okusalowo kwa Mao okusisinkana abakulembeze b'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ng'ekyekito eky'okwagala okwogerwako.
The Mao group's sudden change of attitude was very surprising given that they have been publicly minimizing the Inter Party Corporation.	Engeri ekiwayi kya Mao okwekyusa mbagirawo kyali kyewuunyisa olw'okuba nti kyali kyagala nnyo amawulire g'omukago ogutaba ebibiina bye byobufuzi.
Musumba said they were not interested in spoiling in childish politics.	Musumba yagamba nti tebaali beetegefu kumala biseera mu byabufuzi bya kito.
She said the Inter Party Corporation had written to the Mao group to join Inter Party Corporation but they refused.	Yagamba nti omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi gwali gwawandiikira ekiwayi kya Mao okugwegattako naye nga kyagaana.
They later decided to examine the legal and political implications of accepting one faction of Democratic Party when the other is out.	Oluvannyuma baatandika okwetegereza enkola ey'amateeka n'enkola z'ebyobufuzi ezandivudde mu kukkiriza ekiwayi kya Democratic Party ekimu ng'ekirala tebakolagana nakyo.
The Inter Party Corporation then subjected the issue to a legal and political survey.	Omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ensonga gwagizza ku kunoonyereza kw'amateeka n'ebyobufuzi.
Musumba said, it was then Mao and his group came accompanied by journalists to meet the Inter Party Corporation.	Musumba yagamba nti mu kiseera ekyo Mao n'ekibinja bajja nga bawerekeddwako bannawawulire okusisinkana omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi.
She said it appears Mao's Democratic Party is neither interested in joining the Inter Party Corporation nor cooperating with them on anything.	Yagamba nti kirabika nga ekiri nti Democratic Party ya Mao teyagala kwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi oba nga tekolagana nakyo mu ngeri yonna.
Mao had said after the Inter Party Corporation meeting that Democratic Party was up to exploring the form.	Oluvannyuma lw'olusisinkana olwo n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyofuzi Mao yagamba nti Democratic Party yali egezaako okunoonya engeri z'okukolamu emirimu.
The Mao group wants to field their own presidential candidate but can cooperate with the Inter Party Corporation on other areas.	Ekibinja kya Mao kyagala kusimbawo omuntu waakyo avuganye ku Bwapulezidenti olwo kikwatagane n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi mu bifo ebirala.
Mao also said he supports the Inter Party Corporation position to have the current Electoral Commission changed.	Mao era yagamba nti akkaanya n'eky'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi okukyusa engeri ebyobufuzi gye bikolebwamu.
Musumba said this was Mao's trick to hinder the IPC from considering the option of accepting the other Democratic Party faction.	Musumba yagamba nti kano kaali kakodyo ka kiwayi kya Mao okulaba ng'omukago gwa IPC tegulowooza ku kya kukkirirza kwegattibwako kiwayi kya Democratic Party ekirala.
However Mathias Nsubuga, the secretary general of the Mao Democratic Party, said it's the Inter Party Corporation who invited them for a meeting.	Wabula Mathias Nsubuga, ssaabawandisi wa Democratic Party, yagambye nti omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi nti gwayitibwa mu lukungaana.
Musumba removed Nsubuga's claim.	Musumba yamazeewo Nsubuga by'ayogera.
She said Mao's group came for other reasons other than the invitation because they had long ignored it.	Yagamba nti ekiwayi kya Mao kyajja lwa nsonga ndala ezitali ku kuyitibwa kubanga baali baludde nga bagyewala.
Some members of the Inter Party Corporation say they have put on hold the decision to accept one Democratic Party group.	Bammemba abamu ab'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi bagamba nti baayimirizza eky'okusalawo ku kukkiriza okuyingiza ekimu ki biwayi bya Democratic Party.
Dr Frank Nabwiso believes the two groups can reconcile.	Dr Frank Nabwiso alina okukkiriza nti ebiwayi ebibiri bisobola okutabagana.
But the Lubega faction is looking at admission into the Inter Party Corporation rather than reconcile with the Mao group.	Naye ekiwayi kya Lubega kiruubirira bukulembeze bw'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi so si kutabagana n'ekibinja kya Mao.
In an interview with Lubega before Mbale conference early this year, his position on joining Inter Party Corporation was the same as Mao's. 	Mu mboozi ey'akafubo ne Lubega eyaliwo nga ttabamiruka w'e Mbale tannabaawo, endowooza ye ku kwegatta ku IPC yali y'emu ng'eya Mao.
The Democratic Party would not join the Inter party Cooperation because the party always lost their members in such unions.	Democratic party si yakwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina kubanga ekibiina kizze kiviibwako bammemba bakyo mu mikago ng'egyo.
Observers say he was one sided to take his Democratic Party camp into the 2011 elections without the backing of other opposition parties.	Abatunuulizi b'ensonga bagamba nti yalina kyekubiira okutwala enkambi ye eya Democratic Party mu kulonda kwa 2011 nga tasembeddwa bibiina by'oludda oluvuganya ebirala.
They were also facing a lot of pressure from the Mao group.	Era baali basanga okunyigirizibwa kungi nnyo okuva mu kibinja kya Mao.
The Mao group ignored reconciliation with the Lubega group.	Ekibinja kya Mao kyesamba okutabagana n'ekibinja kya Lubega.
Nsubuga said that court declared Mao the lawful leader of the Democratic Party.	Nsubuga yagambye nti kkooti yalangiridde Mao ng'omukulembeze wa Dmocratic Party mu mateeka.
He says the Lubega group must succumb to Mao, who was elected in the Mbale Delegates Conference.	Agamba nti ekibinja kya Lubega kirina okugondera Mao eyalondeddwa mu lukiiko ttabamiruka e Mbale .
Both Democratic Party groups have been holding similar activities since the Mbale conference.	Ebibinja bya Democratic Party byombi bibadde bikola emirimu gye gimu okuva lwe byava mu lukiiko e Mbale.
Mukasa Mbidde told the Independent that they asked the police to block the meeting of the Lubega's group in Nsambya Sharing Hall.	Mukasa Mbidde yagambye Independent nti baasaba poliisi okulemesa olukungaana lw'ekibinja kya Lubega ku Nsambya Sharing Hall.
According to the Independent issue on August 27- September 02, 2010, Mubatsi reported, Mao seeks to work with the Inter Party Cooperation.	Okusinziira ku Independent eyafulumizibwa nga 27 Ogwomunaana okutuka Ogwomwenda nga 02, 2010, Mubatsi yagamba nti Mao anoonya kukolagana n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina.
The Inter Party Cooperation brings together five opposition parties.	Omukago ogutaba ebibiina gugatta wamu ebibiina ebitaano ebiri ku ludda oluvuganya.
Four of the five parties nominated their candidates except Uganda People's Congress.	Ebibiina bina ku bitaano byasunsula abeesimbyewo ng'oggyeko Uganda People's Congress.
The Ugandan People's Congress, the third largest opposition party in parliament, did not attend the nominations at Kololo Airstrip.	Uganda People's Congress, ekibiina ekyokusatu mu bunene mu paalamenti, tekyetaba mu kusunsula ku kisaawe ky'ennyonyi e Kololo.
The nomination was extended to August 23 to give Uganda People's Congress time to nominate its candidate, but the deadline elapsed.	Okusunsula kwayongezebwayo okutuka nga 23 Ogwomunaana okuwa Uganda People's Congress obudde okusunsula abantu baayo naye ssalessale yayitako.
This time Otunnu pointed out unresolved issues under the Inter Party Cooperation arrangement which must be sorted out first.	Omulundi guno Otunnu yanokoddeyo ensonga ezitannakolwako wansi w'enteekateeka z'omukago ogutaba ebibiina ezirina okusooka okukolwako.
It's not the pending arrest of Otunnu that had prevented the Uganda People's Congress from nominating its candidate to Inter Party Cooperation.	Okusibwa kwa Otunnu si kwe kwagana Uganda People's Congress okusunsula abantu baayo okwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina.
It provided practical coverage for growing conflicts within the Inter Party Congress.	Kyateekawo engeri y'okugonjoolamu obukuubagano mu mukago ogutaba ebibiina.
The Inter Party Congress will nominate the joint candidate on August 31.	Omukago ogutaba ebibiina gujja kusunsula abeesimbyewo okuva mu bibiina eby'enjawulo nga 31 Ogwomunaana.
There is a strong feeling that the Inter Party Cooperation is being run mainly by the Federation of Democratic Change.	Waliwo okukkiriza kwa maanyi nti omukago ogutaba ebibiina gusinga kuddukanyizibwa Federation of Democratic Change.
The UPC says the Federation of Democratic Change is running Inter Party Cooperation activities without involving the other participating parties.	UPC egamba nti Federation of Democratic Change eddukanya emirimu gy'omukago ogutaba ebibiina awatali kwetabyamu bibiina birala ebirimu.
Sources within the Ugandan People's Congress say that the party wants Otunnu to be the Inter Party Congress joint candidate.	Ensonda okuva mu Ugandan People's Congress zigamba nti ekibiina kyagala Otunnu avuganye ku bwa mmemba bw'omukago ogutaba ebibiina.
The Uganda People's Congress supported the Democratic Party's Paul Ssemogerere in the first interparty union in 1996 and Kizza Besigye in 2001.	Uganda People's Congress yawagira Paul Ssemwogerere owa Democratic Party mu kwegatta kw'ebibiina okwasooka mu 1996 ne Kizza Besigye mu 2001.
The Uganda People's Congress will not settle for anything short of Otunnu being the automatic Inter Party Cooperation flag bearer.	Uganda People's Congress tejja kuwummula okutuusa nga Otunnu alondeddwa okukulembera omukago ogutaba ebibiina
They would rather quit the Inter Party Cooperation arrangement and contest in 2011 as a party rather than an alliance.	Waakiri bava muntekateka z'omukago ogutaba ebibiina ne beesimbawo mu 2011 ng'ekibiina okusinga okwegatta awamu.
They say Otunnu's cabinet is completely against their leader.	Bagamba nti kabinenti ya Otunnu ewakanyiza ddala omukulembeze waabwe.
It was set up by the Uganda People's Congress.	Kyatandikibwawo Uganda People's Congress.
The rejection of the Electoral Commission was advanced by Olara Otunu.	Okugaana kw'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kwayogerwako Olara Otunu.
The Forum for Democratic Change has since diverted it into pretending it was their idea.	Forum for Democratic Change okuva olwo yakyusa nga yeeyisaako nti kyali kirowozo kyayo.
Why did they take part in the elections even though they knew that the Electoral Commission was for the National Resistance Movement?	Lwaki beetaba mu kulonda ng'ate baali bakimanyi nti akakiiko k'ebyokulonda ka National Resistance Movement?
The Uganda People's Congress participated in the 2006 elections as well, which were presided over by the same Electoral Commission.	Uganda People's Congress yeetaba ne mu kulonda okwa 2006, okwategekebwa akakiiko k'ebyokulonda ke kamu.
The Uganda People's Congress is questioning why the Forum for Democratic Change did not reject the Electoral Commission in 2006.	Uganda People's Congress yeebuuza lwaki Forum for Democratic Change teyagaana kakiiko k'ebyokulonda mu 2006.
It's clear that the Inter Party Congress partnership was hurriedly entered without much thought into the details of how it would work.	Kyeraga lwatu nti okukolera awamu mu mukago ogutaba ebibiina kwapapirwa okuyingirwamu ewatali kutunuulira ngeri gye guyinza kukolamu.
The Uganda People's Congress claims that it never supported the idea of a joint candidate at this stage of the elections.	Uganda People's Congress yeemulugunya nti teyawagira kirowoozo kya kuleeta muntu omu bwe kyatuka ku kulonda.
Our initial agreement in the Inter Party Congress was that we jointly fight the political harassment and the election malpractices.	Okukkiriziganya kwafe okwasooka mu mukago ogutaba ebibiina kwali kulwanyisiganyiza wamu okutulugunyizibwa mu byobufuzi n'emize emibi egirabikira mu bululu.
Without a fifty percent win Museveni would be forced to go for a re-run.	Awatali kuwangula na bitundu ataano ku kikumi Museveni yandikakiddwa okuddamu okuvuganya.
The Uganda People's Congress says the Forum for Democratic Change has changed from that position.	Uganda People's Congress egamba nti Forum for Democratic Change ekyuse okuva mu kifo ekyo.
This hot fallout was mainly between the Forum for Democratic Change and the Uganda People's Congress.	Okuyomba kuno okusinga kwali wakati wa Forum for Democratic Change ne Uganda People's Congress.
When the parties came out of the meeting Otunnu made an unreal statement that the Uganda People's Congress has never said.	Ebibiina bwe byafuluma mu lukiiko, Otunnu yakola sitatimenti etaali ntuufu ku Uganda People's Congress gyetaayogera.
He did not clarify whether he would submit himself for Inter Party Cooperation nominations.	Teyalambulula oba ng'aneetaba mu kusunsula kw'omukago ogutaba ebibiina.
The confusion made it worse when Otunnu said he could not readily say he would be nominated by August 31.	Okutabulwa kweyongera Otunnu bwe yagamba nti teyali mwetegefu kusunsulwa nga 31 Ogwomunaana.
Otunnu told the press that the Uganda People's Congress will decide accordingly after they have reviewed the Inter Party Congress decisions.	Otunnu yagamba bannamawulire nti Uganda People's Congress ejja kusalawo oluvannyuma lw'okulaba okusalawo kw'omukago ogutaba ebibiina.
Lukyamuzi, Besigye and Kyanjo asked Otunnu if the Uganda People's Congress was withdrawing from the Inter Party Congress.	Lukyamuzi, Besigye ne Kyanjo baabuuza Otunnu oba nga Uganda People's Congress yali eva mu mukago ogutaba ebibiina.
They were welcomed with songs of Uganda Patriotic Movement as they took up their seats.	Baayanirizibwa n'ennyimba za Uganda Patriotic Movement nga bwe batuula mu bifo byabwe.
It was the birth of the Uganda Patriotic Movement.	Eyo ye yali entadikwa ya Uganda Patriotic Movement
Yoweri Museveni was the temporary chairman and vice chairman of the Military Commission.	Yoweri Museveni ye yali ssentebe ow'ekiseera era omumyuka wa ssentebe w'akakiiko k'amaggye.
These people, together with many others, found themselves unable to join either the Uganda People's Congress or the Democratic Party.	Abantu bano n'abalala bangi beesanga nga tebasobola kwegatta ku Uganda People's Congress oba ku Democratic Party.
Museveni warned that the Ugandan people are fed up with dictatorship and are now concerned about a disciplined democracy.	Museveni yalabula nti Bannayuganda bakooye obwannakyemalira era kati bafa nnyo ku demokolasiya owempisa.
The Uganda Patriotic Movement includes groups like the Front for National Salvation which fought Amin for eight years.	Uganda Patriotic Movement erimu ebibinja nga Front for National Salvation ekyalwanyisa Amin okumala emyaka munaana.
Museveni warned that anyone who has the ambition of becoming a dictator in Uganda would be pushed out.	Museveni yalabula nti omuntu yenna alina ekiruubirirwa ky'okufuuka nnakyemalira mu Uganda ajja kusindiikirizibwa.

In 1980, when it first contested elections, it was the Uganda Patriotic Movement political party.	Mu 1980, lwe kyasooka okuvuganya mu kulonda kyali kiyitibwa Uganda Patriotic Movement Political Party.

So does Ruhakana Rugunda.	Ne Ruhakana Rugunda naye bw'atyo.
This means that the survival of National Resistance Movement depends on the existence of Museveni.	Kino kitegeeza nti okubeerawo kw'ekibiina kya National Resistance Movement kwesigamiziddwa ku kubeerawo kwa Museveni.
There are no permanent interests that hold the Movement together apart from the worship of Museveni's personality.	Tewali bigendererwa bya lubeerera ebikuumira omugendo awamu okuggyako okugulumiza Museveni ng'omuntu.
The things that held the Movement together from 1980 to 1986 have since faded away.	Ebintu ebyali bikuumira ekibiina awamu okuva mu 1980 okutuuka mu 1986 okuva olwo byaseebengerera.
President Museveni justified his 1981 rebellion because Milton Obote cheated in the 1980 elections	Pulezidenti Museveni yawagira olutalo lwe yakola mu 1981 kubanga Milton Obote yabba mu kulonda kwa 1980.
Milton Obote did this by using violence and intimidation against the opposition.	Milton Obote yakola kino nga akozesa efujjo wamu n'okutiisatiisa ab'oludda oluvuganya.
During his 25 year rule as president, the National Resistance Movement has failed to organise free and fair elections.	Mu myaka abiri mu etaano gy'amaze ng'afuga nga pulezidenti, ekibiina kya National Resistance Movement kiremereddwa okutegeka akalulu ak'amazima n'obwenkanya.
The first presidential elections were held in 1996 ten years after he captured power in 1986.	Akalulu k'obwapulezidenti akaasooka kaaliwo mu 1996 emyaka kkumi oluvannyuma ye okuwamba obuyinza mu 1986.
During the election campaign, Museveni released his opponent, Paul Ssemogerere, who had no counterpart in the Great Lakes region.	Mu biseera by'okunoonya akalulu, Museveni yata amuvuganya Paul Ssemogerere ataalina gwakolagana naye mu bitundu ebyetooloddwa ennyanja.
In 2001, this political defeat led to the birth of a second Movement called the Reform Agenda.	Mu 2001, okuwangulwa mu byobufuzi kuno kwaviirako okutondebwawo kw'omugendo ogwokubiri ogwayitibwanga Reform Agenda.
The second Movement comprised of deserters from the first Movement who were disgusted by the narrowing democratic space.	Omugendo ogwokubiri gwalimu abo abaava mu mugendo ogwasooka abaali beetamidwa okunyigirizibwa.
It was led by Dr Kizza Besigye, a retired colonel who had formerly served as National Resistance Movement's national political supervisor.	Kyali kikulemberwa Dr. Kizza Besigye kkano eyawummula eyali yaweerezaako mu National Resistance Movement ng'omutunuulizi w'ebyobufuzi.
The Forum for Democratic Change also comprised other former National Resistance Movement members.	Forum for Democratic Change nayo yalimu abaaliko bammemba ba National Resistance Movement.
The Reform Agenda was contesting power in the 2001 elections.	Reform Agenda yali erwanira buyinza mu kulonda kwa 2001.
Besigye fled the country for four years and many of his supporters were also harrased out of the country.	Besigye yafuluma eggwanga okumala emyaka ena era n'abawagizi be bangi nabo baatulugunyizibwa wabweru w'eggwanga.
Besigye returned in 2005 for a second battle with Museveni and by 2006, the second Movement had grown in number and strength.	Besigye yakomawo mu 2005 ku lutalo olwokubiri ne Museveni era mu 2006 omugendo ogwokubiri gwali guwezezza abantu n'amaanyi.
The dissatisfied National Resistance Movement candidates had become discontented under the manner in which the 2006 election had been held.	Aba National Resistance Movement abeesimbawo tebaali bamativu n'engeri okulonda kwa 2006 gye kwakolebwamu.
They claimed that the NRM 2006 party primaries had been rigged and decided to contest the general elections as independent candidates.	Beemulugunya nti akamyufu ka NRM aka 2006 kaali kabiddwa era ne basalawo bavuganye mu kalulu ka bonna ku bwa nnamunigina.
They remained loyal to the National Resistance Movement once they succeeded on individual merit.	Baasigala bagondera National Resistance Movement kasita baayitiramu ku busobozi bwabwe nga ssekinoomu.
About ninety five percent of the thirty seven independent Members of Parliament are connected to the National Resistance Movement.	Ebitundu ebikunukiriza kyenda mu bitaano ku kikumi ku babaka ba Paalamenti asatu mu musanvu abeesimbawo ku bwa nnamunigina balina akakwate ku National Resistance Movement.
A common political front challenged the National Resistance Movement existing condition.	Ekibiina ky'ebyobufuzi ekimanyikiddwa kyawakanyizza embeera National Resistance Movement gy'erimu.
They cannot stand up as a force to challenge Museveni for the state power today.	Tebasobola kuvaayo nga eggye okuvuganya Museveni ku buyinza leero.
There was recent chaos in the National Resistance Movement primaries.	Waaliwo obuvuyo mu kamyufu ka National Resistance Movement.
They are cursing the National Resistance Movement for messing up the election.	Bakolimira National Resistance Movement olw'okutabangula okulonda.
As long as they are benefiting personally under the National Resistance Movement, they are willing to tolerate the rot and remain loyal.	Kasita baba nga baganyulwa mu National Resistance Movement, beteefuteefu okukkiriza buli kimu n'okusigala nga beesimu.
And for that reason Museveni and the National Resistance Movement will not treat them harshly.	N'olwensonga eyo Museveni ne National Resistance Movement tebajja kubayisa bubi.
Democratic free and fair elections have never been a value dearly and deeply held by the National Resistance Movement.	Okulonda okw'amazima n'obwenkanya tekubeerangako kwa mugaso era tekutegekebwangako National Resistance Movement.
It has only been used to give the National Resistance Movement a democratic face in the public.	Kikozeseddwa bukozesebwa okulaga abantu nti National Resistance Movement essa ekitiibwa mu mateeka.
That's why it has been easy for the National Resistance Movement to abandon the 1980 promise of free and fair elections.	Eyo y'ensonga lwaki kibadde kyangu National Resistance Movement obutatuukiriza kisuubizo kyayo ekya 1980 eky'akalulu ak'amazima n'obwenkanya.
One of the values to which the National Resistance Movement has not withdrawn on is, joining of power.	Ebimu ku bintu lwaki National Resistance Movement tevuddeko kwe kugatta obuyinza.
They pursued it as a matter of life and death through the bush war in 1981.	Baagitwala ng'ensonga y'obulamu n'okufa mu lutalo lw'omunsiko mu 1981.
The events in the recent National Resistance Movement primaries, Museveni did not go to the bush to fight Milton Obote for rigging elections.	Ebikolebwa kati mu kulonda kw'akamyufu National Resistance Movement, Museveni teyagenda mu nsiko okulwanyisa Milton Obote olw'okubba obululu.
The National Resistance Movement party has a chaos and selfish history.	Ekibiina kya National Resistance Movement kirina obuvuyo n'ekyafaayo ky'okweyagaliza kyokka.
According to Andrew Mwenda, Besigye is right compared to Otunnu.	Okusinziira ku Andrew Mwena, Besigye mutuufu bw'omugeraageranya ku Otunnu.
Besigye shares a similar feeling but believes that the demand for electoral reform should be incidential.	Besigye alina endowooza y'emu wabula akkiriza nti obwetaavu bw'enkyukakyuka mu kulonda bulina kuba bwa mbagirawo.
I agree with Otunnu in principle but side with Besigye on the matter of practical politics.	Nzikiriziganya ne Otunnu mu buntu wabula ate nzikiriziganya ne Besigye mu nsonga z'ebyobufuzi.
Otunnu does not appreciate the hard choices the opposition is faced with.	Otunnu tasiima okusalawo okuzibu oludda oluvuganya kwe lusanga.
The opposition will now have a platform to register its grievances and demands before the wider Ugandan public.	Oludda oluvuganya kati lujja kuba n'oluwenda okulaga obutali bumativu bwalwo n'ebyetaago byalwo nga tebinnatuuka eri Bannayuganda.
It will give President Museveni an opportunity to run a one man show.	Kijja kuwa pulezidenti Museveni omukisa obutavuganyizibwa.
I often find most freedom and accountability activists in Uganda missing in this important communication.	Emirundi egisinga eddembe n'abalwanirizi b'eddembe mu Uganda bafiirwa okuwuliziganya okulungi
I made this point during the Temangalo debate.	Nayogera ku nsonga eno mu kukubaganya ebirowoozo ku Temangalo.
The procurement process in the National Social Security Fund was full of changes.	Enteekateeka y'okugula ebintu mu National Social Security Fund yali ejjudde okukyusibwa
It was better to hold the fund to account for delivering five thousand cheap houses in Temangalo and hang Amama Mbabazi later.	Kyali kisingako okulindako okussa ssente ku akaawunti ez'okuwaayo ku mayumba enkumi ttaano aga layisi e Temangalo oluvannyuma Amama Mbabazi awanikibwe.
The naive and emotional gossiping classes of Kampala were swayed by their personal desires.	Abatalina kye bamanyi n'abengambo mu Kampala buzunga nga beenoonyeza byabwe.
We lost both ways, the project failed and Mbabazi was not punished.	Twafiirwa mu ngeri zombi, pulojekiti yafa ne Mbabazi teyabonerezebwa.
Uganda's opposition has huge technological and economic opportunities that it can build on to defeat Museveni.	Oludda oluvuganya mu Uganda lulina tekinologiya n'ebyenfuna bingi bye lusobola okukozesa okuwangula Museveni.
The opposition has grown its base from twenty four percent of the vote in 1996 to forty one percent in the last election.	Oludda oluvuganya lwongedde ku bululu okuva ku bitundu abiri mu bina ku kikumi mu 1996 okutuuka ku bitundu ana mu kimu ku kikumi mu kulonda okuwedde.
Uganda should have a perfect election process.	Uganda erina okuba n'okulonda okulungi ennyo.
Karl Popper in his book, Conjectures and Refutations, offered the best insight.	Karl Popper mu kitabo kye, Conjectures and Refutations, yaggyayo amakulu agasinga.
It is unlikely that Uganda can get a free and fair election today.	Si kyangu nti Uganda esobola okubeera n'akalulu ak'amazima n'obwenkanya leero.
Otunnu had a passionate desire with digging out the past of Luwero and the Northern War.	Otunnu yalina obwagazi bw'okumalawo ebyali bimanyiddwa ku Luwero n'olutalo lw'omu bukiikakkono.
America was involved in an endless debate on slavery.	America yeenyigira mu kukubaganya ebirowoozo okutakoma ku buddu.
Majority of Ugandan voters are between the ages of eighteen and thirty.	Bannayuganda abalonzi abasinga bali wakati w'emyaka kkumi na munaana n'asatu.
They were too young to care about what happened in Luwero.	Baali bato nnyo okufaayo kw'ebyo ebyaliwo e Luwero.
Making Luwero an electoral issue in 2010 meant discussing issues that interest 1% of voters.	Okufuula Luwero ensonga y'ebyokulonda mu 2010 kyategeeza kuteesa nsonga ezisikiriza 1% ez'abalonzi.
People in northern Uganda have suffered a million and one injustices under Museveni's rule.	Abantu mu Bukiikakkono bwa Uganda babonyeebonye n'obutali bw'enkanya emirundi akakadde kamu wansi w'obukulembeze bwa Museveni.

Gideon Badagamawa, an expert on environment and natural resources, explains that plastic is non biodegradable hence affets soils.	Gideon Badagamawa, omukugu mu byobutonde bw'ensi, annyonnyola nti ebintu ebya pulasitiika tebivunda nga n'olw'ekyo bikosa ettaka.
Badagamawa says over fifty percent imports of food come to Africa, not because we cannot produce food but because our soils have degenerated because they are chocked with plastics.	Badagamawa agamba nti emmere etundibwa mu Afirika esukka mu bitundu ataano ku kikumi, sso lwa nsonga nti tetusobola kwerimira mmere wabula kubanga ettaka lyaffe liddiridde olw'okwonoonebwa ebintu ebya pulaasitiika.
Badagamawa says that well managed recycling programs can reduce pollution.	Badagamawa agamba nti enteekateeka y'okusaanuusa ebintu ekendeeza ku butonde okwonooneka.
In poor countries like Uganda, reducing plastic usage is not an easy task.	Mu mawanga amaavu nga Uganda, okukendeeza okukozesa ebyapulaasitiika si mulimu mwangu.
Uganda manufactures warned that banning plastics, which are largely used for packaging, would increase costs of production.	Abakola ebyamaguzi mu Uganda baalabula nti okuwera ebintu ebya pulaasitiika ebisinga okukozesebwa kusabika ebyamaguzi kyandifuula okufulumya ebyamaguzi okw'obuseere.
It would also increase prices of consumer goods.	Era kyandirinnyisa n'emiwendo abantu kwe bagulira ebyamaguzi.

In reaction to Kony's orders, Angola reported clearly that he failed to control Acaye Ecomog.	Mu kwanukula ebiragiro bya Kony, Angola yamunnyonnyola lwatu nti yali alemeddwa okufuga Acaye Ecomog.
The news of Acaye Ecomog and Angola's reaction to Kony's orders to command other commanders, has put Kony in another state of confusion.	Amawulire g'ebyakoleddwa Acaye ne Angola ku biragiro bya Kony okuduumira abaduumizi abalala kitadde Kony mu kutabulwatabulwa okulala.
It is a big sign of loss of command and control on Kony's side.	Kabonero kanene akalaga nti Kony takyali mu mitambo era takyasobola kufuga mbeera.
We expect Kony to harass and use Lukwiya as his army commander to arrest that situation.	Tusuubira Kony okuyisa obubi Lukwiya ng'omuduumizi we ow'amagye okukkakkanya embeera eyo.

Museveni too rejected the opposition's call for electoral law reforms just like Muwanga in one thousand nine hundred eighty.	Museveni naye yagaana enkyukakyuka mu tteeka ly'okulonda nga Muwanga mu lukumi mu lwenda mu kinaana.

Uganda has held four elections since one thousand nine hundred eighty.	Uganda ebadde n'okulonda kwa mirundi ena okuva mu lukumi mu lwenda mu kinaana.
The participating political parties in the electoral process are suspicious of the independence of the Electoral Commission.	Ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ebyetabye mu kulonda bibuusabuusa obwetengereze bw'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda.
The Electoral Commission organises credible elections without due influence from the ruling party.	Akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kategeka okulonda okulungi okutaliimu kusendebwasendebwa kibiina ekiri mu buyinza.
Many analysts say that the selection of Electoral Commission members must be by a neutral committee comprising Ugandans of national integrity.	Abatunuulizi b'ensonga bangi bagamba nti okulonda bammemba b'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kulina kukolebwa akakiiko akatalina ludda nga kaliko Bannayuganda abeesimbu.
The Electoral Commission members especially the chairperson and secretary should never again be persons handpicked by the ruling party alone.	Bammemba b'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda naddala ssentebe n'omuwandiisi tebalina kuddamu kulondebwa kibiina kiri mu buyinza kyokka.

AMISOM as the AU and UN mandated peace keeping force has a limited capacity to protect the Presidential Palace, Mogadishu airport.	AMISOM ng'ekiragiro kya AU ne UN eky'okukuuma emirembe tebirina busobozi kukuuma lubiri lw'obwapulezidenti, Mogadishu airport.
The Uganda People's Defence Force presence within the AMISOM framework does not answer the needs of the Ugandans.	Okubeera kwa Uganda Peolpe's Defence Force mu AMISOM tekyanukula byetaago bya bannayuganda.
When the population talks of wiping out Al-Shabaab from Somalia, they mean militarily defeating them thus removing ability of launching attacks.	Abantu bwe boogera ku kusaanyaawo Al-Shabaab mu Somalia, bategeeza okubawangula mu by'ekijaasi awo ne baba nga tebakyalina busobozi kukola bulumbaganyi.
Since the Uganda People`s Defence Force cannot achieve that goal, the only feasible option is to withdraw from Somalia.	Olw'okuba nti Uganda People's Defence Force tesobola kutuukkirza kirubirirwa ekyo, ky'esobola kyokka okukola kwe kuva mu Somalia.
We can then, as a member state of the UN, ask the UN Security Council for a mandate forcefully invade Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab.	Ffe nga bammemba ba UN tusaba akakiiko k'ebyokwerinda okuyisa ekiragiro okuyingira mu Somalia ku kifuba twengange Al-Shabaab.
This strategy would allow Uganda to launch attacks against the Al-Shabaab.	Enkora eno yandisobozesezza Uganda okukola ennumba ku Al-Shabaab.

During its National Executive Conference in January, the NRMovement declared it had registered 8 million members including the under age.	Mu lukungaana lwayo olw'akakiiko akafuzi mu Gatonya, NRMovement yalangirira nti yali ewandiisizza bammemba obukadde munaana omuli n'abali wansi w'emyaka.
This was before the EC started the national voter registration exercise which also yielded about 15 million voters, up from 10 million in 2006.	Kino kyaliwo nga EC tennatandika nteekateeka ya kukebera nkalala z'abalonzi era ekyavaamu abalonzi obukadde 15 okuva ku bukadde 10 mu 2006.
The NRM has been registering people it calls its members across the country.	NRM ebadde ewandisa abantu b'eyita bammemba abaayo okwetoloola eggwanga lyonna.
The Electoral Commission also doubts the authenticity of the NRM figures.	Akakiiko akalonzi nako kabuusabuusa obutuufu bw'emiwendo gya NRM.
Early this year, the NRM also doubted the genuineness of the EC's national voter register, alleging that it contained two million ghost names.	Nga omwaka guno gutandika, NRM nayo yabuusabuusa obutuufu bw'enkalala z'abalonzi ez'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda, ng'egamba nti zirimu amanya obukadde bubiri ag'empewo.
Uganda's demographic statistics put the 2009 population projections to 30.6 million.	Ebibalo by'abantu mu Uganda mu 2009 baatuuka ku bukadde 30.6.
This implies that 14.2 million Ugandans are above 18 and thus qualified to register as voters.	Kino kitegeeza nti obukadde 14.2 obwa Bannayuganda bali waggulu w'emyka 18 n'olw'ekyo bakkirizibwa okwewandiisa ng'abalonzi.
Population estimates published by the Population Secretariat rise even more questions on the Electro Commission's 15 million voters.	Enteebereza y'omuwendo gw'abantu eyafulumizibwaeggwandiisizo ly'emiwendo gweyongera n'ebibuuzo ebisingawo ku balonzi b'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda obukadde 15.
The estimates for 2010 show Ugandans of 18 years and above are 13.9 million, up from 12.9 million in 2008.	Ebyateberezebwa bya 2010 biraga bannayuganda eb'emyaka 18 n'okugenda waggulu bali obukadde 13.9 okuva ku bukadde 12.9 mu 2008.
Given the high apathy among Ugandans to register for voting and death of some registered voters, the number of new voters would be fewer.	Olw'okuba nti Bannayuganda tebaagala kwewandiisa kulonda n'okufa kw'abalonzi abawandiise, omuwendo gw'abalonzi abapya gwandibadde wansi.
However, the EC has said this is not the final figure.	Newankubaddde EC egambye nti guno si gwe muwendo ogw'enkomeredde.
Even if some superman had inherited the presidency, it was practically impossible for anyone to govern Uganda.	N'omufuusa ne bwe yandisikidde pulezidenti, kyandibadde kizibu omuntu yenna okulembera Uganda.
Various conflicting parties had begun fighting for power back in Moshi sorted out each other.	Ebibiina eby'enjawulo ebyali byatandika okulwanira obuyinza mu Moshi byatabagana.
After the fall of Idi Amin, all successor regimes were nothing but caretakers, stop-gap measures, until the final showdown.	Oluvannyuma lwa Idi Amin okuva mu buyinza, emirembe gyonna egyaddako gyali gya kaseera buseera okutuuka lwe gyaviirawo ddala.
This only happened in one thousand nine hundred eighty-six with President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement emerging as a victor.	Kino kyatuukawo mu lukumi mu lwenda kinaana mukaaga oluvannyuma lwa National Resistance Movement eya Pulezidenti Yoweri Museveni okuwangula.
It is therefore surprising that Binaisa, in spite of all this, was able to hold on to power for nearly a year.	Nolwekyo kyewuunyisa nti nga oggyeko bino byonna, Binaisa yasobola okumala mu buyinza kumpi mwaka mulamba.
Ugandans might as well be grateful that here was a man who never craved to be president.	Bannayuganda bayinza okuba abasanyufu nti wano waaliwo omusajja ataayayaanira kuba Pulezidenti.
He held Uganda together, made her laugh and was gradually steering her to normality before the forces of instability struck.	Yakuuma Uganda nga eri bumu, yasekererwa naye mu mpola mpola baatandika okumwagala obutabanguko bwe bwali nga tebunnatuukawo.
He asserted civilian supremacy by demoting the Army Chief of Staff, General Oyite Ojok.	Yakakasa obuyinza bw'omuntu wa bulijjo nga assa eddaala ly'akulira amagye, Genero Oyite Ojok.
An umbrella government was embraced by National Resistance Movement once it came to power.	Gavumenti ey'awamu yateekebwawo National Resistance Movement bwe yajja mu buyinza.
Binaisa was also not a corrupt president as his personal life reveals.	Binaisa naye yali Pulezidenti atalya nguzi ng'obulamu bwe obwa bulijjo bwe bulaga.
Immediately after the loss of his presidency, he fled back to New York where he resumed his law practice.	Amangu ddala ng'avudde ku bwa pulezidenti, yaddayo e New York okuddamu okukola obwannamateeka bwe.
In the year one thousand nine hundred eighty-six, soon after the National Resistance Movement government had come to power he returned.	Mu mwaka gwa lukumi mu lwenda kinaana mukaaga, amangu ddala nga National Resistance Movement ezze mu buyinza, yakomawo.

The 1967 constitution that followed allowed him detention without trial for which he suffered under the British.	Ssemateeka wa 1967 eyaddirira yamukkiriza okusibibwa awatali kuwozesebwa ekyamubonyaabonya mu Bangereza.
The British imprisoned him for a year in Moroto, Karamoja.	Abangereza baamusibira e Moroto, Karamoja okumala omwaka.
Subsequently, he resigned as Attorney General in one thousand nine hundred sixty-seven.	Oluvannyuma, yalekulira obwa ssaabawolereza wa gavumenti mu lukumi mu lwenda  nkaaga musanvu.
In being opportunistic in his political views, no one can deny that he was a pan African nationalist throughout his life.	Mu kweyagaliza mu birowoozo bye ebyobufuzi, tewali n'omu ayinza kuwakana nti yali mwagazi nnyo owa Afirika mu bulamu lwe.
Mr Binaisa's nationalism was born out of his personal experiences at the discriminative hands of the British as a student.	Obwagazi bw'eggwanga obwa Mwami Binaisa bwava ku bye yayitamu ng'omuntu oluvannyuma lw'okusosolebwa bwe yali omuyizi e Bungereza.
Mr Binaisa was an enterprising African miner and resident in Britain in the early fifties.	Mwami Binaisa yali mulombe Omufirika omulowooza, omwetegefu okwenganga nsonga yonna mu Bungereza mu gy'ataano nga gyakatandika

He got disillusioned with Musaazi's leadership walked out on him to be led by Apollo Obote under the Uganda Peoples Congress.	Yaggwamu amaanyi n'obukulembeze bwa Musaazi n'abuvaamu n'adda ewa Apollo Obote mu kibiina kya Uganda Peoples Congress.
Though descending from a royal lineage Binaisa was willing to risk the anger of his Baganda tribesmen for his republican beliefs.	Newankubadde yali mabega mu lulyo olulangira, Binaisa yali mwetegefu okwanganga obusungu bw'Abaganda banne olw'ebyo by'akkiririzaamu.
He always opposed the separatist politics of the Mengo government.	Yawakanyanga ebyobufuzi bya gavumenti y'e Mengo eby'enjawukana.
Here he was ahead of his time as the Mengo government has since abandoned the idea of a secessionist government.	Wano yali yeteeseteese mu budde bwe nga gavumenti y'e Mengo okuva olwo egaana gavumenti ey'okukolera awamu.
Mahmood Mamdani has also pointed the failure of the Baganda to play a leading role in the national affairs of this country.	Mahmood Mamdani naye yanokolayo okulemererwa kw'Abaganda okukulemberamu ensonga z'eggwanga lino.
Men like Binaisa and Luyimbazi Zake were willing to pay the price.	Abasajja nga Binaisa ne Luyimbazi Zake baali beetegefu okukisasulira.
Binaisa was a very committed and excellent lawyer well respected by his peers.	Binaisa yali munnamateeka omumalirivu era omulungi ennyo eyassibwangamu banne ekitiibwa.
He was the first Queen's Counsel in East and Central Africa, served the Judicial Service Commission, headed the Law Society of Uganda!	Ye munnamateeka wa nnaabakyala eyasookera ddala mu buvanjuba ne masekkati ga Afirica, yaweereza ku kakiiko ka bannamateeka , yakulira ekibiina kya bannamateeka mu Uganda.

However, his legal career, much like that of fellow lawyer Nelson Mandela suffered many arrests.	Wabula, omulimu gwe ogw'amateeka nga munnamateeka munne Nelson Mandela yakwatibwa emirundi mingi.

Binaisa, who died at ninety was very much a twentieth-century man.	Binaisa, eyafiira ku kyenda yali ng'omusajja ow'ekyasa ky'abiri.
He was shaped by most of the same upbringing, education, religion, ethnicity, professional career and attitude as most enlightened Ugandan.	Yakuzibwa mu mbeera esinga okuba nga yemu, okusoma, eddiini, eggwanga, omulimu n'endaba y'ebintu nga bannayuganda abalala abasomyeko.

In Uganda malaria is responsible for nearly half of inpatient child deaths.	Mu Uganda, kyenkana ekitundu ku muwendo gw'abaana abafiira mu malwaliro bafa musujja gwa nsiri.
I had never seen Museveni as happy as this.	Nali sirabanga Museveni nga musanyufu nga kati.
The pictures showing President Museveni laughing at his own jokes by a comedian bring some healing to the nation that has been under attack.	Ebifaananyi bya kazannyiikirizi ebiraga Pulezidenti Museveni ng'aseka mu kusaaga kwe bireetawo obutoowolokofu eri eggwanga eribadde lirumbiddwa.

In the hectic schedule and duties of the President, sometimes it is good to ease his stress levels given his demanding office.	Mu mirimu gya pulezidenti egya kaweerege, ebiseera ebimu kirungi okukendeeza ku bikumalako emirembe olwa woofiisi ye ensukkulumu.
When the President is happy good things are likely to happen.	Pulezidenti bwaba omusanyufu ebintu ebirungi bisuubirwa okutuukawo.
That is why a gesture of comedy like that of Ssegujja is necessary.	Eyo y'ensonga lwaki obwakatemba ng'obwa Ssegujja bwetaagisa.
Great job Ssegujja.	Ssegujja, mulimu gwa ttendo.

Your greatest resource ultimately is the people of Uganda.	Eky'obugagga kyo ekikyasingidde ddala be bantu ba Uganda.

I believe it was not fair for the District Police Commander to be dismissed because every time police use excessive force, the public condemns them.	Nsuubira nti tekyali kya bwenkanya eri akulira poliisi ku disitulikiti okugobebwa kubanga buli poliisi lw'ekozesa eryanyi erisukkiridde abantu baginenya.
Unfortunately, in this case, it is the District Police Commander who became a victim.	Eky'ennaku, mu mukisa guno, akulira poliisi ku disitulikiti ye yanenyezeddwa.
Mr President, we call upon your urgent intervention to protect the people of Naguru and Nakawa Estates.	Mwami Pulezidenti, tukusaba oyingirewo bunnambiro okutaasa abantu b'e Naguru ne Nakawa.

Naguru-Nakawa tenants Kalyegira is a conspiracy theorist, not a rebel.	Abapangisa b'e Naguru-Nakawa, Kalyegira muntu akola ebintu ebimenya amateeka wabula si muyeekera.
I agree with Daniel Kalinaki that Timothy Kalyegira is a conspiracy theorist rather than a terrorist.	Nzikiriziganya ne Daniel Kalinaki nti Timothy Kalyegira mumenyi w'amateeka naye nga si mutujju.
I think whatever Kalyegira writes is up to the readers to make up their own minds on whether it is true or not.	Nze ndowooza buli Kalyegira ky'awandiika kiri eri abasomi okukitwala mu ndowooza zaabwe oba kituufu oba nedda.
I do not believe in conspiracy theories but it is wrong for the government to arrest Kalyegira.	Sikkiririza mu ndowooza za bumenyi bw'amateeka naye kikyamu gavumenti okukwata Kalyegira.

The suspect was a retired Captain Francis Gakwerera, a businessman based in Mozambique but also a former soldier.	Ateeberezebwa yali kaputeeni eyawummula Francis Gakwerera, omusuubuzi asinziira e Mozambique era eyaliko omujaasi.
Francis is a former soldier in the Ugandan, Rwandan army but he finally joined the Congolese army.	Francis yali musirikale mu Uganda, mu magye g'e Rwanda naye ate oluvannyuma ne yeegatta ku magye g'e Congo.
Kayumba had a few months earlier escaped from Rwanda and launched a scathing criticism of President Paul Kagame and his government.	Kayumba nga wayiseewo emyezi mitono emabega yali atolose e Rwanda n'atandika okukolokota okutaali kulungi ku Pulezidenti Paul Kagame ne gavumenti ye.
It seemed the Rwandan government was behind this attempted assassination.	Kyalabika nga gavumenti ya Rwanda eyali emabega w'olukwe lw'obutemu buno.
Gakwerera's profile suggests that he was the right man for such a job.	Ebikwata ku Gakwerera biraga nti ye yali omusajja omutuufu okukola omulimu ogwo.
He is a close family friend of Kayumba; so he knew the victim well.	Mukwano gwa Kayumba ow'oku lusegere nolwekyo yali amanyi bulungi avunaanibwa.

She said Gakwerera is a close friend of the family and could not have been involved in the attempted assassination of her husband.	Yagamba nti Gakwerera mukwano gwa famire era yali tayinza kwetaba mu kwagala kutemula bbaawe.
Gakwerera who was released after five days without any charges also denies involvement.	Gakwerera eyateebwa nga wayiseewo ennaku ttaano nga tagguddwako misango gyonna naye yeegaana okwenyigiramu.

There were also two other suspects; one from Kenya, and the other from Tanzania.	Waaliwo era n'abateeberezebwa abalala babiri, omu ng'ava Kenya, ate omulala ava Tanzania.
The arrest of Bachisha was surprising given that he seemed loyal to his boss having helped him escape from Rwanda in the middle of the night.	Okukwatibwa kwa Bachisha kwali kwewuunyisa kubanga yalabika ng'omwetowaze eri mukama we oluvannyuma lw'okumuyamba okutoloka e Rwanda mu masekkati g'ekiro.
He escaped from Rwanda on February twenty-eighth.	Yatoloka okuva e Rwanda nga abiri mu munaana Ogwokubiri.
Bachisha was put in the same jail as Gakwerera.	Bachisha yateekebwa mu kkomera lye limu nga Gakwerera.
However, immediately they met, Bachisha poured out his heart to Gakwerera.	Wabula, amangu ddala baasisinkana Bachisha n'abuulira Gakwerera byonna ebyamuli ku mutima.
He claimed that after Bichisha arrived in South Africa, he was called on the telephone by someone claiming to be Doctor Ndahiro.	Yategeeza nti oluvannyuma nga Bichisha atuuse e South Africa, yakubibwa essimu ey'omuntu eyeetwala okuba musawo Ndahiro.
Ndahiro asked him to kill Kayumba on behalf of the Rwandan government.	Ndahiro yamusaba okutta Kayumba ku lwa gavumenti ya Rwanda.
Ndahiro promised to pay him two thousand dollars for the job.	Ndahiro yasuubiza okumusasula ddoola enkumi bbiri olw'omulimu.
Bichisha claimed that he later met agents sent by this Doctor Ndahiro who gave him only six hundred dollars.	Bichisha yagamba nti oluvannyuma yasisinkana ababaka abaasindikibwa musawo Ndahiro abaamuwa ddoola olukaaga zokka.
It is here that Bichisha's story becomes even more intriguing.	Wano emboozi ya Bichisha w'esingira ddala okunyuma.
He claimed that on Wednesday, June sixteenth, three days before Kayumba was shot, the killers came into Kayumba's house at night.	Yategeezezza nti ku Lwokusatu nga kkumi na mukaaga Ogwomukaaga, ennaku ssatu nga Kayumba tannakubibwa masasi, abatemu bajja mu nnyumba ya Kayumba ekiro.
Bichisha told Gakwerera that Kayumba and his wife were sleeping in their bedroom.	Bichisha yagamba Gakwerera nti Kayumba ne mukazi we baali beebase mu kisenge kyabwe.
According to Bichisha, the assassins left him their contact.	Okusinziira ku Bichisha, abatemu baamulekera ennamba zaabwe.
He later telephoned them on Saturday, June nineteenth and told them that he was going to the shopping mall with Kayumba.	Oluvannyuma yabakubira ku Lwomukaaga nga kkumi na mwenda ogwomukaaga n'abagamba nti yali agenda ku mmoolo ne Kayumba.
As agreed, the killers showed up at the mall where one of them shot Kayumba in the stomach.	Nga bwe kyali kikaanyiziddwako, abatemu bajja ku mmoolo era omu ku bo we yakubira Kayumba essasi mu lubuto.
Bichisha claims that later that day, Ndahiro called again and asked him to finish off Kayumba adding that this time Kagame had promised a reward.	Bichisha agamba nti oluvannyuma ku lunaku olwo, Ndahiro yaddamu n'akuba essimu n'amusaba okutta Kayumba n'agattako nti ku mulundi ogwo Kagame yali asuubizza ekirabo.
This is the same story Bichisha later told the South African police and also recorded in his statement.	Oluvannyuma eno y'emboozi y'emu Bichisha gye yabuulira poliisi y'e South Africa era n'akola ne sitatimenti ye.
Bichisha also provided the telephone number from which Ndahiro called.	Bichisha era yawaayo ennamba y'essimu Ndahiro gye yakubirako.
The Chief of the National Security Services which is Rwanda's national intelligence arm is called Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro.	Akulira ebyokwerinda era nga kye kitongole ky'obukessi mu Rwanda ayitibwa Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro.
Therefore, Bichisha seems to be referring to him.	Nolwekyo, Bichisha alabika okuba nga gw'ajulizaako.
First, if these professional assassins knew Kayumba's house and had special keys to enter it, then why did they need Bichisha?	Ekisooka, singa abatemu bano abakugu baali bamanyi ennyumba ya Kayumba era nga baalina ebisumuluzo eby'enjawulo okugiyingira, olwo lwaki baali beetaaga Bichisha?
He seems to be a hindrance to their mission.	Yalabika okuba omuziziko eri ekigendererwa kyabwe.
Second, Bichisha's description of the shooting incident is suspicious.	Ekyokubiri, engeri Bichisha gy'annyonyolamu engeri amasasi gye gaakubwamu erimu okwekengera.
He claims Mrs Kayumba later corroborated this story that a man approached their car as they left the mall and waved at them angrily to stop.	Agamba nti oluvannyuma mukyala Kayumba yapanzeewo eno emboozi nti omusajja yatuukirira emmotoka yaabwe nga bavudde ku mmoolo ng'abayimiriza mu bukambwe.
Bichisha stopped the car and opened the driver's window	Bichisha yayimiriza emmotoka n'assa endabirwamu ku mukono gwa ddereeva.
The man pulled out a pistol and shot once at Kayumba in the stomach.	Omusajja yaggyayo pisito n'akuba Kayumba essasi limu mu lubuto.
The man walked around the car to Kayumba's side where they wrestled for a while before the man fled.	Omusajja yeetooloola emmotoka ku ludda okwaliko Kayumba gye baalwanira okumala akabanga ng'omusajja tannagenda.
The second reason is that the heroic story of Kayumba wrestling the assassin sounds like a Hollywood movie.	Ensonga ekyokubiri eri nti emboozi ya Kayumba ey'obuzira okulwana n'omutemu ewulikika nga ffirimu y'omu Hollywood.
Is this really what happened or this is the version of events Kayumba, his wife and their driver wanted the world to hear?	Kino ddala kye kyaliwo oba eno y'engeri Kayumba, mukyala we ne ddereeva waabwe gye baayagala ensi okubiwuliramu?
if Ndahiro wanted to kill Kayumba, would he telephone the General's driver whom he did not know and ask him to collaborate in the effort?	Bwe kiba nga Ndahiro yali ayagala kutta Kayumba, yandikubidde ddereeva wa Genero gwe yali tamanyi n'amusaba bakwatagane mu nsonga eno?
If what Kayumba's driver is saying is true, was someone impersonating Ndahiro?	Bwe kiba nga ddereeva wa Kayumba ky'ayogera kituufu, waliwo eyali attattana erinnya lya Ndahiro?
The fourth reason is that there is no evidence linking Bichisha to those who tried to kill Kayumba.	Ensonga eyookuna eri nti tewaliiwo bukakafu bukwasaganya Bichisha n'abo abagezaako okutta Kayumba.
Even if he was involved, why was he so willing to implicate himself in a case of attempted murder that in South Africa carries up to twenty years in jail?	Ne bwe kiba nga yalimu, lwaki yali ayagala nnyo okwewaayo mu musango gw'okugezaako okutemula ogusibya omuntu mu kkomera okumala emyaka abiri mu South Africa.
Gakwerera claims Bichisha's story sounded rehearsed.	Gakwerera agamba nti emboozi ya Bichisha yawulikika ng'empangirire.
To whom was Bichisha working?	Bichisha yali akolera ani?
Security experts say Bichisha could have been a mole planted inside the prison by South African police to gather information from other suspects.	Abakugu mu byokwerinda bagamba nti Bichisha ayinza okuba nga yali asimbidda poliisi y'e South Africa okufuna amawulire ku bateeberezebwa abalala.
But there is another twist in the Kayumba shooting incident that places South African authorities in credibility problems.	Naye waliwo enkyukakyuka mu musango gwa Kayumba ogw'okuba amasasi oguteeka abobuyinza ba South Africa mu buzibu bw'okwesigibwa.
Bichisha entered South Africa on a Ugandan passport issued on April twenty-first two thousand ten.	Bichisha yayingira South Africa ng'akozesa paasipooti ya Uganda eyafuluma nga abiri mu lumu Ogwokuna enkumi bbiri mu kkumi.
It is this passport that Bichisha used when identifying himself before the South African police.	Pasipooti eno Bichisha gye yakozesa nga yeeyanjula eri poliisi y'e South Africa.
Yet in all their press releases, the South African police have never revealed that one of the suspects is Ugandan.	Kyokka ate mu biwandiiko ebirala bye baawa bannamawulire, poliisi y'e South Africa tefulumyangako nti omu ku bateeberezebwa Munnayuganda.
Gakwerera claims Bichisha's story sounded rehearsed.	Gakwerera agamba nti emboozi ya Bichisha yawulikika ng'empangirire.
Those arrested in connection with the shooting claimed that they had been approached by people who claimed that Kayumba had killed their relatives.	Abo abaakwatibwa mu lukwe lw'okukuba amasasi baagamba nti baali batuukiriddwa abantu abaali bagamba nti Kayumba yali asse abenganda zaabwa.
Kayumba was head of Rwanda's National Security Services, the state's intelligence agency.	Kayumba ye yali akulira ebyokwerinda by'e Rwanda, ekitongole ky'eggwanga ekikessi.
These people paid them money to kill Kayumba.	Abantu bano baabasasula ssente okutta Kayumba.
However, these Rwandans claimed, since they had been paid in advance, they took the money but did nothing.	Wabula, Abanyarwanda bano baagamba nti olw'okuba nti baali basasuddwa nga tebannakola mulimu, baatwala ssente naye tebalina kye baakola.
The two Rwandan suspects are actually known petty criminals.	Abanyarwanda babiri abateeberezebwa bamanyiddwa ng'abazzi b'emisango emitonotono.
The Rwanda government had applied for their extradition accusing them of breaking into its High Commission in Pretoria and stealing property.	Gavumenti y'e Rwanda yali esabye baddizibweyo e Pretoria oluvannyuma lw'okumenya ekitebe kya Pretoria ne babba ebintu.
South African authorities had been dragging their feet on the case.	Aboobuyinza mu South Africa baali babalinnya kagere olw'emisango gyabwe.
There has been a lot of politics in Kayumba's case.	Mubaddemu ebyobufuzi bingi mu musango gwa Kayumba.
First, on the day he was shot, the deputy president of South Africa showed up at the hospital where Kayumba had been admitted.	Okusookera ddala, ku lunaku lwe yakubwa amasasi, amyuka Pulezidenti wa South Africa yalabikako mu ddwaliro Kayumba gye yali aweereddwa ekitanda.
He was joined by South Africa's former chief spy, Bill Masetera, a close friend of Patrick Karegyeya also a dissident with Kayumba.	Yeegattibwako eyali akulira bambega e South Africa, Bill Masetera mukwano ennyo gwa Patrick Karegyeya bwe bali ennyo ku mbiranye ne Kayumba.
Masetera was the head of South Africa's National Intelligence Agency when Karegyeya was Rwanda's director of External Security.	Masetera ye yali akulira ekitongole ekikessi mu South Africa Karegyeya gye yali akulira ebyokwerinda wabweru wa South Africa.
Masetera later became a security advisor to former South African president, Thabo Mbeki.	Masetera oluvannyuma yafuuka omuwabuzi ku byokwerinda ow'eyaliko pulezidenti wa South Africa, Thabo Mbeki.
The two fell out over allegations that Masetera was secretly enhancing the power of Mbeki's main rival and current president, Jacob Zuma.	Ababiri baalemagana oluvannyuma lw'ebigambibwa nti Masetera nti yali ayongedde amaanyi mu mulabe wa Mbeki asingayo era Pulezidenti aliko, Jacob Zuma.
Masetera's relationship with Karegyeya became stronger as, he now claims, presidents tend to use and dump their intelligence chiefs.	Enkolagana ya Masetera ne Karegyeya yeeyongera nga bw'agamba kati, nti bapulezidenti batera okukozesa abakulira obukessi ate bwe bamala ne babasuulawo.
What was Museveni's game plan in this Kayumba saga?	Museveni yalina ntekateeka ki ku bino ebyatuuka ku Kayumba?
"As top Rehabilitation Project Force officials pondered this issue, ""a friend"" from the American Central Intelligence Agency called Kigali."	"Abakulira pulojekiti y'okuddaabiriza balowooza nnyo ku nsonga eno, ""Owoomukwano"" okuva mu  American Central Intelligence Agency ayitibwa Kigali."
He claimed that Kayumba had sent a message to Museveni seeking contact.	Yategeeza nti Kayumba yali asindikidde Museveni obubaka ng'asaba bakolagane.
Francis Gakwerera says he lives in Mozambique where he has been running a business since two thousand five.	Francis Gakwerera agamba nti abeera mu Mozambique gy'abadde addukanyiza bizinensi okuva mu enkumi bbiri mu etaano.
However, whenever I am travelling between Maputo and Kigali, I travel through South Africa.	Wabula, buli lwe mbeera ntambulira wakati wa Maputo ne Kigali, mpitira mu South Africa.
I also buy things from South Africa which I sell in Mozambique.	Era ngula ebintu e South Africa bye ntunda e Mozambique.
How did you get arrested in relation to shooting Kayumba?	Wajja otya okukwatibwa ku byekuusa ku musango gw'okukuba Kayumba amasasi?
I was in South Africa in transit to Maputo.	Nali mu South Africa nga ngenda Maputo.

I arrived Wednesday and was arrested on Saturday.	Nnatuuka ku Lwokusatu ne nkwatibwa ku Lwomukaaga.
